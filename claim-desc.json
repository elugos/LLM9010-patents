LUEL- LEN, a citizen of the United States, residing at Newton, in the county of Middlesex and State of Massachusetts, have invented a new and useful Cup, of which the following is a specification.\nIn the development of coin-controlled apparatus for dispensing beverages, for which I filed, on April 2, 1908, an application for Letters Patent, Serial No. 424,732, I have found it desirable to employ a cup, so organlzed and of such inexpensive material, that it may be automatically delivered by a vend ing machine from a. stock or supply with the l1qu1d contents, it being considered as included in the sale, to be thrown away or otherwise disposed of by the purchaser.\nThe object of the present invention is to provide a convenient cup or container for this or similar purposes.\nIn the accompanying drawing, in which similar parts are. designated by the same characters throughout the several views, Figure 1 shows a side elevation of one embodiment of my invention; Fig. 2 is a top plan View thereof, and Fig. 3 illustrates a plurality of the cups nested as they would be in the supply, ready for use.\nMy improved cup, designated as a whole by the character C, is preferably formed from water-proof paper, this material being resilient, cheap and sufficiently durable for nest closely, as illustrated in Fig. 3,-a great number thus placed extending but a little the length andcharacter of the service which the article'is to perform. It has a tapering side wall 10 and a flat bottom portion 11, which may be assembled and secured in any desired manner, the, method of making not playing a part in the present invention.\nThe frusto-conical 'form and the comparative thinness of the wall lOallows the cups to distance, yet the edges about the openings of successive cups in the nested ser1es are separated by definite though narrow spaces m.\n' Adjacent to the opening ofeach cup is a I projection which I prefer to furnish by a continuous flange l2iYftegral with the wall 10, it consisting of a single thickness of the paper turned over and ly ng substantially in the plane of the edge,\nthat 1s, at right angles to the longitudinal axisof the cup but forming an obtuse angle with the side wall.

This alone'would determine that the angle which the flange forms with the .flan e to the side wall. The natural position wall should not be more obtuse than that existing when the flange is at right angles to the cup-axis. Furthermore, as the flange passed this plane, or approached coincidence with the inclination of the wall, it would offer less resistance to being further bent in the same direction, diminishing its effectiveness as an engaging means. On the other hand, it may be desired that after the cup has been thus seized, it shall be inverted and filled with liquid, and that the weight of the cup and contents shall then withdraw it from the engaging mechanism by bending or straightening out the flange. so, to avoid undue resistance to such release, the angle of the flange with the cup-wall should not be less obtuse than ninety degrees with re- This fixes the angle of spect to the axis. maximum effectiveness at the intermediate position already described. The flange also strengthens the cup, and, because o'f its per- \"pendicular position with respect to the axis,\noffers the greatest resistance to lateral crushing stresses with a minimum of material and of labor in forming. In this connection there should be noted the peculiar cooperationbetween the cups when nested and theirf i flanges. Each cup as then strengthened, not only by its own flange but by those of a con siderable number of other cups which surround it. Consequently, when arranged in a series, the cups may be more safely forced together and handled. The overlapping cups of the series also tend to maintain the true circular cross-section of the terminal cup, and thus prevent its flattening by the inward spring of the sides and slipping out of the engaging means when the latter is drawing it from the stock. But after the separation of the cup from its fellows the lateral compression acts with the bending of the flange to aid in release.\nHaving thus described my invention, I claim and desire to secure by Letters Patent:",

    "title": "Crochet hook",
    "description": "April 1953 G. A. CARLSON 2,635,444\nCROCHET HOOK Filed Nov. 1, 1949 IN VEN TOR.\nPatented Apr. 21, 1953 CROCHET HOOK Gustav A. Carlson, Chicago, Ill., assignor to The Boye Needle Company, Chicago, 111., a comaration of Illinois Application November 1, 1949, Serial No. 124,870\n2 Claims. (01. 66-118) This invention relates to a crochet hook or the like.\nIn the manufacture of crochet hooks, it has heretofore been the practice to employ a hook or beak connected by a cylindrical throat or stitch-forming neck to the main body of the hook. The side faces of the head of the hook or beak are bulging and rounded so as to merge with the rounded walls of the neck or stitchforming throat. Such a structure is illustrated in my patent No. 2,024,794.\nWhile the foregoing structure is a desirable structure, I have discovered that .the movement of the stitches onto and off of the hook is surprisingly improved by making the sides of the head and preferably also the throat portion of the structure flat. Thus the side Walls of the throat and head form a substantially continuous taper and with relatively wide and flat side faces.\nAn object of the invention is to provide a crochet hook having flattened side faces on its head. A further object is to provide a crochet hook having a body portion tapering at its front toward a hook head and with the sides of the head and tapered portion flattened. Other speciflc objects and advantages will appear as the specification proceeds.\nThe invention is illustrated in a single embodiment, by the accompanying drawing, in which- Figure 1 is a perspective view of a crochet hook embodying my invention; Fig. 2, a broken enlarged side view in elevation; Fig. 3, a top plan view; and Fig. 4, a transverse sectional view, the section being taken as indicated at line 4-4 of Fig. 2.\nIn the illustration given, in designates 2. cylindrical crochet hook body which, if desired, may be flattened in a horizontal plane at H. Forwardly of the flattened portion I I, the structure is provided with a tapering stitch-forming portion or throat l2 which merges into the head [3. The head I3 is provided with a beak M which preferably extends rearwardly, as illustrated more clearly in Figs. 2 and 3.\nIn the structure shown, I prefer to form the crochet hook structure at its forward end with flat side walls I5 and it. The flattened side walls may extend across the entire outer portion of the head and preferably also extend rearwardly along the neck or throat portion 12 of the hook. If desired, the top portion of the throat l2 may be flattened as indicated at H in Fig. 3. Further, if desired, the top portion 2 of the throat may be left rounded and the sides of the head and throat only flattened in the vertical plane.\nIn the operation of the hook, the stitches are formed as in the usual practice, by the flattened sides which are found to give a much smoother and faster crocheting operation. Why the stitches move so readily and quickly along the crochet hook, I am unable to say with definiteness but it is a fact that the flattened side walls of the head and neck or throat of the structure enable the stitches to be moved in either direction with great speed and smoothness and the crocheting operation is greatly speeded up. It may be that the greatest point of frictional resistance in the crocheting operation has been along the sides of the head and throat and that by providing these surfaces with relatively wide flat areas that the stitches work against a much smaller area of resistance and slide much more easily over such surfaces.\nIn the operation of the hook, a stitch is drawn onto the hook and the hook then passed through the material to engage in the thread. In so doing, the stitch-forming throat or portion I2 preforms the loop so that it may be readily slipped over the head and then the new stitch is drawn forwardly. In this operation, a minimum of frictional area engages the loop that is being formed so that it slides very readily over the head, etc.\nWhile in the foregoing specification I have set forth a structure in considerable detail for the purpose of illustrating one embodiment of the invention, it will be understood that such details of structure may be varied widely by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of my invention.\nI claim:",

Serial No. 211,100. 2\nT rtZZ whom it may concern.-\nBe it known that we, DANIEL M. RUNDLE and RALPH IV. RUNDLE, citizens of the United States, residing at Harrisburg, Saline county, State of Illinois, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Egg-Cases, of which the following is a specification containing a full, clear, and exact description, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, forming a part hereof.\nOur invention relates to improvements in knockdown shipping-cases, and is designedespecially for egg-cases; and it consists of the novel features herein shown, described, and claimed.\nIn the drawings, Figure 1 is a plan of an egg-case blank ready to be built up. Fig. 2 is a perspective of the egg-case built up with the cover raised. Fig. 3 is a vertical longitudinal section of the egg-case with the cover closed. Fig. 4 is an end elevation of the egg case with the cover open. Fig. 5 is a vertical cross-section of the egg-case. Fig. 6 is a horizontal section through one end of the eggcase upon an enlarged scale and showing the detail of the fastening device. Fig. 7 is an edge view, upon an enlarged scale, of a piece of the material from which the egg-case may be constructed.\nReferring to the drawings in detail, the eggcase blank comprises the rectangular bottom portion 10, the side portions 11 and 12, hinged to or formed integral with the bottom portion, the end portions 13 and 14, hinged to or formed integral with the bottom portion, the end portions 15 and 16, hinged to or formed integral with the side portion 11, the end portions 17 and 18, hinged to or formed integral with the side portion 12, the cover portion 19, hinged to or formed integral with the side portion 11, and the end portions 20 and 21, hinged to or formed integral with the ends of the cover portion 19.- The blank may be formed from a sheet of tough paper or cardboard or strawboard, or it may be formed of cellular material, as shown in Fig. 7, or any similar or suitable material.\nIn setting up the egg-case the end portions 15 and 17 overlap, and the end portions 16 and 18 overlap, then the end portions 13 and 14 are bent upwardly outside of these end portions 15 and 17 and 16 and 18, thus making three thicknesses of the material at each end of the case. The central partition 22 is substantially the same size as the end portions and is inserted between the sides 11 and 12. The partition-fastener is formed of wire and comprises theupper hook 23, the central loop 24, the lower hook 25, the intermediate portion 26, connecting the hook 23 to the loop 24, the intermediate portion 27, connecting the loop 24 to the hook 25, the eye 28, engaging the hook 25, the bar 29, extending through the loop 24, the hooks and 31 upon the ends of the bar 29, and the eyes 32 and 33, engaging the books 30 and 31. The eye 28 is inserted upwardly through the opening 34 at the center of the bottom portion 10. The partition 22 is placed in position. The hook 23 is pressed downwardly upon the upper edge of the partition. The loop 24 is pressed through the opening 35 at the center of the partition. The hook 25 is inserted through the eye 28. The'bar 29 is inserted through the loop 24. The eyes 32 and 33 are inserted inwardly through the openings 36 and 37 in the side portions 11 and 12, and the hooks 30 and 31 are inserted downwardly through the eyes 32 and 33. The intermediate portions 26 and 27 serve as vertical braces for the partition, and the bar 29 serves as a horizontal brace for the partition. The ends of the wires forming the eyes 28, 32, and 33 are bent at right angles to the eyes to form stops and prevent the eyes from being drawn through the material of the egg-case.\nThe end fasteners are formed of wire, and each fastener comprises the central portion 38, the spring- eyes 39 and 40, extending outwardly from the ends of the central portion, and the stops 41 and 42, extendingoutwardly from the eyes 39 and 40. The eyes 39 are inserted through the alined openings 43, 44, and 45, and the eyes are inserted through the alined openings 46, 47, and 48 in the three end portions at each end of the egg-case, thus leaving the cover 19 open. The outer part of the eyes are enlarged to form the shoulders 49 and 50, and spring-wire is used, so that the eyes will snap through the openings, said shoulders serving to hold the eyes in position.\nIVhen it is desired to close the cover, it is pressed downwardly into position and the eyes 39 and 40 are inserted through the openings 51 and 52 in the cover portions 20 and 21. hen desired, the bails 53, having the hooks 5 1 and 55 at their end, may be applied by inserting the hooks 5e and 55 through the eyes 39 and 10. The bails may be used either before the cover is closed or afterward, as desired, said bails being readily removable and replaceable.\nIt is obvious that the details of construction may be varied in many ways without departing from the spirit of our invention. For instance, the cover-section might be disconnected from the remaining part of the blank, and the different portions of the blank might be constructed separately and connected together by strips of cloth or hinged together in any suitable way instead of forming the entire blank out of a single sheet of material.\nWVe claim 1. In a knockdown shipping-case: the bottom portion the side portions 11 and 12 hinged to the bottom portion; the end portions 13 and 14 hinged to the bottom portion; the end portions 15 and 16 hinged to the side portions 11; the end portions 17 and 18 hinged to the side portion 12; the cover portion 19 hinged to one of the side portions; and the end portions 20 and 21 hinged to the cover portion; there being alined openings 43, 14, a5 and 52 in the four end portions; anda second series of alined openings 16, 47, 48 and 51 in the four end portions, in combination with fasteners, each fastener comprising the central portion 38, the spring- eyes 39 and 10 extending outwardly from the ends of the central portion and adapted to be inserted through the alined openings; and the stops 4:1 and r2 extending outwardly from the eyes 39 and substantially as specified.\n2.

Buttery, Kalamazoo, Mich., assignor to Sutherland Paper Company, Kalamazoo, Mich., a corporation of Michigan Application July 12, 1946, Serial No. 683,029 I The main objects of this invention are:\nFirst, to provide a collapsible box or carton I which may be formed of a single blank and one in which the parts are associated so that the box may be quickly set up or erected and one in which the parts are very effectively retained in position when the box is erected.\nSecond, to provide a box or carton of this character which is well adapted for the display of merchandise-for example, fruit and various bakery products.\nThird, to provide a structure having these advantages which may be very economically pro duced from comparatively light stock and at the same time is quite rigid when set-up.\nObjects relating to details and.economies of the invention will appear from the description to follow. The invention is defined and pointed out in the claims.\nA preferred embodiment of the invention is 6 Claims. (01129-30) illustrated in the accompanying drawing, in\nwhich:\nFig. 1 is a perspective View of a carton embodying the features of the invention fully set up.\nFig. 2 is a bottom perspective view of the collapsed carton.\nFig. 3 is a top perspective view of the collapsed carton.\nFig. 4 is an enlarged fragmentary perspective view of the erected carton.\nFig. 5 is a fragmentary perspective view illustrating certain stages of the erection of the carton by the preferred method.\nFig. 6 is a fragmentary perspective view illustrating the succeeding stage in the erection of the carton.\nFig. 7 is a plan view of the blank.\nThe embodiment of the invention illustrated is formed of a single blank and comprises a bottom designated generally by the numeral I and made up of bottom members or sections 2 and 3. These members or sections 2 and 3 are disposed at the ends of the blank. The blank is folded and separated from their inner edges by slits 8. The ends of the end walls and the ends of the side walls are connected by corner members ll hingedly secured to the end walls at II and to the side walls at l2. These corner members are diagonally scored at l3 to permit. folding of the corner-members on the inner sides of the end walls as is shown inFigs. 1 and 4.\nThe end walls are provided with tucking flap extensions l4 hingedly connected thereto at 15 desirably by a series of spaced slits. These tucking flaps are adapted to be tucked between the folded corner members and the bottom.\nThe tucking flaps are provided with slits Is at the ends of their hinge connections to the end walls, these slits being engageable with lugs I! provided therefor to coact therewith, these lugs being formed on the bottom edges of the corner members or the comer members being formed to. provide these lugs.\nThe end'walls desirably extend substantially above the side walls and are provided, in the preferred embodiment, with wrapper supporting flaps or extensions l8 connected thereto by the weakened or hinge lines l9. It will be observed that the extra height of the end walls and their wrapper supporting flaps are formed from stock in the blank between the side walls.\nWith the blank cut and scored as illustrated and folded to bring the bottom members into overlapping relation, the bottom members being secured in this relation, .a tubular structure is provided such as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.\nTo erect the carton, pressure is applied to the opposite edges of the folded carton, as shown in Fig. 2, preferably with the carton in inverted position. The end walls may be simultaneously swung to erected position and the locking flaps l4 inserted by grasping as indicated in Fig. 5, thrusting inwardly upon the end walls, desirably both ends simultaneously, and when the flaps II are completely inserted the lugs 11 snap into slits or slots l6 locking the box in'erected position. This same movement will turn the wrapper supporting flap inwardly. The carton may then be turned to upright position and filled. Commonly, a transparent wrapper is wrapped around the filled carton, the inturned wrapper supporting flaps serving to eifectively support the ends of the wrapper during wrapping and facilitating the wrapping.\nMy improved carton is economical to produce and may be folded to the tubular form shown in Figs. 5 and 6 by types of folding and gluing machines now in extensive use.\nThe structure is economical in material and even when formed of comparatively light stock is quite strong and rigid It is not likely'to accidentally collapse.\nI have illustrated and described the invention in a. tray type of container such as is extensively used in the packaging of tomatoes and certain other fruits and vegetables and bakery products. It should be understood, however, that it is capable ofa very wide range of adaptations in the matter of size and proportions and these depending quite largely on particular uses.\nIt is believed that this disclosure will enable those skilled in the art to embody or adapt the invention as may be desired and therefore these contemplated adaptations are not illustrated or described.\nHaving thus described my invention, what I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is:",

MELLO SANITARY WATER-CLOSET BOWL Filed June 20, 1955 FIGS  2,853,?13 Patented Sept. 30, 1958 ice SANITARY WATER-CLOSET BOWL Romualdo da Silva Mello, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil I Application June 20, 1955, Serial No. 516,720\n3 Claims. (Cl. 469) The present invention relates to sanitary bowls. Conventional sanitary or toilet bowls, although in same becomes very difficult and requires the use of mechanical means such as a brush. In the novel bowl such a drawback is avoided because fecal matter projected upon the steeply inclined wall 1 will rapidly slide therefrom and because flushing takes place in the direction of fall of the fecal matter. It is possible for the user to place a sheet of tissue paper over the sloping part of the bowl, at the point of incidence of the fecal matter whereby the latter is tobogganed downward by flushing.\ncommon use in the more developed countries, are subject to various deficiencies as regards the receiving and disposal of waste materials.\nIt is an object of the invention to overcome these deficiencies which will hereinafter be described in greater detail.\nIn the drawing in which conventional bowls are compared with the improvements provided by the invention:\nFigs. 1 and 2 illustrate, in longitudinal section, two conventional types of bowls;\nFigs. 3 and 4, respectively, are top and sectional views of a further conventional bowl;\nFig. 5 is a top view of a-bowl provided in accordance with the invention; and\nFig. 6 is a longitudinal section of the bowl of Fig. 5.\nWith regard to the conventional bowls shown in Figs. 1 and 2, there exists the possibility of the splashing of contaminated water when fecal matter is discharged into the same. This is not hygienic and exposes the user to germs and dirt.\nThe dished bottom bowl shown in Figs. 3 and 4 is similarly deficient as regards the splashing of water and, moreover, provides a ledge for the accumulation of fecal matter whereby deposits may reach the body of the user. Further, this type of bowl is readily dirtied and requires constant cleaning.\nIn accordance with the invention, there is provided, instead of a conventional dished bottom which is horizontal and has a large surface, a substantially different bowl as illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6.. Said bowl has certain similarities to the ordinary dish bottomed bowl and to the conventional bowl, but differs structurally and functionally from both.\nThe bowl of the invention has a comparatively steep slope along a fairly long expanse 1, from back to front, so that the water surface or trap is restricted to the front part 2 of the device and thus is spaced from the point of fall of fecal matter. Said fecal matter will thus fall against the surface of bowl 1 which has a steep slope and becomes horizontal at terminal part or ledge 3, before reaching water trap 2. Fecal matter dropped onto thissteep slope 1 slides rapidly along same and comes to rest on the terminal part 3 which preferably has a surface above the normal water level in the bowl and which constitutes in fact a receptacle wherefrom it is finally removed by the water discharge. A discharge conduit 4 is connected in siphon-like arrangement to trap 2 and includes an apex 5 determining the normal water level in the trap.\nIn this way fecal matter may be easily inspected and, since it does not fall directly on the water, it will not give rise to splashing water onto the user. Said receptacle 3, not directly beneath falling fecal matter, contains no more than a minimum quantity of water such as a few millimeters, which is only enough to prevent fecal matter from adhering to the lower bowl wall. Sometimes fecal matter adheres so well that removal of the This is, in fact, one of the advantages of the new bowl since the dish-bottomed bowl and the conventional bowl have walls which are almost vertical with a large water surface so that a greater sprinkling action results.\nAs has been said above, the flushing with water is carried out in the same direction as the fecal matter is to be carried away and thus completely washes the bowl. This also prevents said matter from depositing in the water adjacent the syphon, which water is in very small quantity. Thus both the water and the fecal matter can readily reach the second part of the syphon.\nThe novel bowl is also based on the hydraulic syphon principle, although with recourse to modified action to prevent complete emptying of the bowl, since the water is intended to isolate the discharge conduit from the outer atmosphere.\nThe novel bowl may furthermore be used in place of any existing conventional bowl and substitution is very easy because the dimensions and base arrangement may be the same as in conventional bowls.\nThere will now be obvious to those skilled in the art many variations of the structure set forth, these variations lying within the scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.\nWhat is claimed is:",
    "claims": "What is claimed is:\n1. A water closet bowl comprising an outside Wall defining an oval shaped cavity having a front and rear, a discharge portion connected to the cavity and including an apex defining a normal water level in the cavity, a first wall portion extending into the cavity and supported by the rear portion of the outside wall, said first wall portion being inclined from the horizontal, a substantially horizontal wall portion extendingin front of the center of the bowl, and a second wall portion intermediate said first and horizontal wall portions and integral therewith and supporting said horizontal wall portion substantially at the level of the apex of the discharge portion, said second wall portion being inclined more from the horizontal than said first wall portion.\n2. A toilet bowl comprising an outside wall defining an oval shaped cavity having a front and rear, a discharge portion connected to the cavity and including an apex defining a normal water level in the cavity, an inclined wall portion extending into the cavity and supported at its upper end by the rear portion of the outside wall for directly receiving falling fecal matter, a substantially horizontal wall portion supported on and extending from the lower portion of the inclined wall and terminating in front of the center of the bowl, said horizontal wall portion having an upper surface substantially at the level of the apex of the discharge portion.\n3.

STURGIS, OF KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI.\nLOOSE-LEAF BOOK.\nSpecification of Letters Patent.\nPatented Dec. 10, 1907.\nApplication filed October 161 I906, Serial No. 339.160. Renewed Septemberlz. 1907- Serial No. 394,412.\nTo all whom it may concern:\nBe it known that I, HERBERT M. STURGIS, a citizen of the United States, residing at Kansas City, in the county of Jackson and State of Missouri, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Loose-Leaf Books, of which the following is a specification.\nThis invention relates to loose leaf books of that class in which the leaf-holding rings are held open or closed with a yielding pressure and my object is to' produce a device of this character in which the anchoring elements may be bound to the cover and the leaf holding elements be subsequently connected thereto easily and quickly and also be removed therefrom if desired.\nA further object is to produce bars to which the hooks can be easily and quickly secured so firmly and reliably as to be incapable of working loose under any strain to which the book may be subjected by a fall or from opening or closing the rings.\nA still further object is to produce a loose leaf book which will operate efficiently and reliably, is of ornamental and attractive appearance and can be manufactured economically.\nWith these general objects in view andothers as hereinafter appear the invention consists in certain novel and peculiar fea tures of construction and organization as hereinafter described and claimed; and in order that it may be fully understood reference is to be had to the accompanying drawings, in which- Figure 1, is a sectional perspective view of a loose-leaf book when open and with the leaves omitted. Fig. 2, is a detail perspective view of the anchor plate. Fig. 3, is an enlarged cross section taken on the line IIIIII of Fig. 1. Fig. 4, is a similar view with the rings open and the cover and anchoring elements omitted. Fig. 5, is a sectional perspective view of one of the hookcarrying bars with the hooks omitted. Fig. 6, is a sectional perspective view of one of the hooks. Fig. 7, is a detail perspective view of one of the springs. Fig. 8, is a sectional view of a modified form of hook-carrying bar. Fig. 9, is a cross section of the hookcarrying bars with the hooks omitted, and showing a pin and slot connection between the bars to insure synchronous movement thereof. Fig. 10, is a side view of a semi-el liptic or modified form of spring.\nIn the said drawings, where like reference numerals identify corresponding parts, 1 indicates an anchor plate of segmental form in cross section and rounded by preference at its ends and near the latter slit inwardly at opposite points as at 2 so that the rounded ends may be bent vertically upward to form end walls 3, which end walls are preferably provided with holes 4.\n5 indicates a pair of elliptic springs corresponding by preference in size and contour to the end walls 3 andprovided in their ends by preference with holes 6, rivets 7 being secured in the holes 4 and 6 to secure the springs reliably to the inner sides of said end; walls, the rivets fitting loosely in either the end walls or the springs in order to permit the latter to expand and contract.\n8-8 indicate a pair offlattened tubular bars which conjointly are about equal in width to the length of the elliptic-spring openings, and each of said bars are of length to project at their ends into said openings, the said projecting ends of the bars being preferably of reduced thickness as at 9 with their outer ends referably rounded as at 10 so as to fit snug ly and find journals in the opposite extremities of the openings of said sprmgs.\n1112 indicate segmental hooks of the type common in loose leaf books, their free or upper ends being adapted to interlock together to form complete rings. Their opposite ends extend into the tubular bars through openings 13 in their upper walls as in the preferred construction, or in their outer edges as in the modified form of bar shown by Fig. 8. The inner ends of said hooks are preferably reduced to form substantially rectangular tongues 15 to fit nonrotatably in correspondingly shaped holes 14 in the inner walls or edges of the tubular bars and be riveted therein so as to guard against dislocation. By this construction I provide hook-carrying bars in which it is absolutely impossible for the hooks to have any lateral play or movement and whichare so stiff and rigid throughout that any outward pull or pressure applied on one pair of hooks is distributed upon all of them so that it is impossible for one pair of hooks to move slightly apart without all partaking of such movement in equal degree. In all otherdevices of this class of which I have knowledge the bars 8 are of flat thin metal and on any outward pull applied on either of the end sets of hooks will yield or twist slightly and permit said hooks to open a little before the hooks at the opposite end or the intermediate hooks will move. As a result of this leaves of the books equipped with such devices occasionally become loose at one end and are therefore more apt to be torn in the ordinary handling of the book.\nIn assembling the parts of the book the companion hooks are fitted together at their tendency of the springs to contract transversely or in their direction of their greatest length holding the hooks yieldingly interlocked at their upper ends and with the inner upper corners of the bars in engagement IVhen therings are opened by pulling outward upon a pair of the oppositely disposed hooks, said upper corners, in the upward rocking movement of the bars, elongate the springs in the direction of their length and as said engaging corners pass above the horizontal plane of the bearing edges 10 the spring contracts in the direction of its length until the inner walls or edges of the tubular bars come squarely together as shown in Fig. 4, in which position they are held by the retractile tendency of the springs, and in this connection it will .be noted that because of the depth of the inner edges or walls, the upward and downward movements of the bars is synchronous, though if desired suitable means may be provided for slidingly locking said bars at their inner edges, one exemplification of such means being shown in Fig. 9, where it. will be noticed the inner edge of one bar is provided with a slot 16 and the correspondingedge of the other with a pin or tongue 17 slidingly engaging said slot.\nThe anchor plate can be secured to the cover A in any suitable manner, the preferred method being to place a strip of cloth or equivalent material 18 upon the middle of the cover, then place thereon a metal plate 19 segmental in cross section and provided at its side margins with inwardly disposed and upwardly projecting hooks 20, and next stretch loosely over said last-named plate the binder strip 2]. of thin flexible leather or cloth and secure the opposite edges of said binder strip to the inner sides of the cover in the usual or any preferred manner. The anchor plate is then by preference placed upon the binder strip and pressure is applied to spring or slip it into engagement with the hooks 20, the binding strip being of course interposed between the anchor plate and the hook-equipped plate. When the anchor plate is thus secured the hooks 20 are pressed or crimped downward to effect a permanent union with said plate. It is preferred that the anchor plate be bound to the cover beery and that the remaining elements may be subsequently secured to the anchor plate easily, quickly and cheaply. The book will be provided with the usual perforated leaves,\nnot shown, to be placed upon or removed from the hooks in the usual manner.\nIn Fig. 10, I show a modified form of spring, the same being a semi-elliptic spring 22 which in all essential particulars comprises the upper half of one of the springs 5, the cavities 23 forming the bearing points for the bearing edges 10 of the reduced ends 9 of the tubular bars 8.- The spring is also provided with holes 24 to receive the rivets 7 or equivalent devices for securing it to the end walls 3 of the anchor plate.\nFrom. the above description it will be apparent that I have produced a loose leaf book possessing the features of advantage enumerated as desirable and which obviously may be modified in various particulars with.- out departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims;\nHaving thus described the invention what I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters-Patent, is",

Such type o closet, however, 1s extremely objectionable without the provision of iiushing or draining means therefor, which it is one of the aims of my invention to provide.\nrin object'of lthat part of my invention relating to urinals, is toprovide means for rendering the same clean and sanitary as .by the provision of an effective flushing or .drainage system which may be rendered thorough by including the flushing or drainage of the standing surface for the user or portions adjacent thereto.\nIn 'the type or embodiment of ,my invention herein resented Figure 1 is a horizontal sectiona view 4u en the dotted line- 3-3 .of Fi `3, of a c oset having my invention app ied thereto; Fig. 2 is a vertical sectional vlew upon the dotted line 2-2 of Fig. 1, and Fig. 3 is a vertical sectional view of the closet upon the dotted line 1-1 of Fi 1, and for convenience of illustra tion s owing in the same figure a urinal having one type of my invention applied thereto.\nHaving reference to thattype 4or embodiv ment of my invention herein presented to ldisclose the principles of my invention, the base or feces receiving surface is represented at 1, it bein of any suitable material, but preferab y formed of an im.\n-pervious material such, for example, as vitrified china, porcelain, slate, enameled iron, etc. The said base is preferably integrally cast and is herein shown as having a depending lower ede 2, whereby it may be received upon the oorng or other ' sup port 3, and suitably communicatin with the plumbing system, to which en it is harem shown as having therein an opening for the discharge. casting 4 of the closet Speciucation of Letters Patent. I\nApplication led September 6, 1906. Serial No. 333,413.\ncommunicatiugin any preferred manner as by the outlet 5 preferably with a plumbing system, s uch casting 4-bem of any suitable material such, for examp e, as enameled iron. Anyjpreferred manner of uniting the feces receiving base with the discharge castin may be employed. In the present embo iment of t e invention the two are Patented M3128, 1910 shown as having a dovetailed connection 6.\nI vcontemplate the employment'of means for flushing the feces receiving surface and -to that end may employ any suitable arrangement of devices whereby the same may be flushed eithero durin the use of the closet or at any proper perio before' or thereafter. As a preferred means to iushl the said surface I have, in this embodimentof the invention, shown the feces receiving casting 1 as provided at a suitable point with a fiushing rim 7, having therein a` encirclin water su ply passage 8 provide at suitab e interva s with discharge openings 9 and communicating with a source of water or iiushi'ng medium supply which is shown in Fi 2 as located beneath the liooringat 10 an communicati'ng by suitable pipeswith the flushing rim. The liushingl rim, if this type of flushing means be emp oyed, may if desired bein open communication with the source 'of water supply or a valve may be provided to be operated either automatically, or otherwlse.- y\nIn order that the closet may be used by vone when assuming a squatting or erouching erence to the feces receiving surface that the body of the -user when crouched upon the said sup ort or supports may be. properly resented) with regard to the saidsurface.\nn the present type of the invention I have shown separated foot supports 11 and 12, as clearly shown in Fig. 1, the user1 assuming theproper position thereon preferably with his face to the right viewing Fig. 1. While a single foot support may be used, I preferably employ two, as shown, and Whlle the same may be located in any proper position relative to the feces receiving surface to permit the described operation of the closet, I preferably locate the said support or supports within the boundary of t e ilushed or casting 1 but they may be otherwise formed and secured in an vdesired manner. They are also preferab y, as shown in Fig. 2, raised from the face of the said surface, which is herein shown as sloping downward from all sides to the discharge outlet or outlets. The upper surface of the foot support or supports may be fashioned in any desired manner but are herein shown as corru ated or roughened to provide a firmer foot old. If desired, and as here shown, the said foot supports may have u standing surroundin rims preferablv per orated and be face with some pre erably rough material, such as rubber, waxed fiber, or the like, to secure easier and firmer footing, and may be provided with de ending gulding rims as shown. The upturned) perforated rims protect the foot-rests against the splashing of Water while the perforations permit them to be flushed and drained when desired and thereby kept clean and sanitary. The location of the foot-rests so as to be entirely surrounded by the flushed and drained area keeps them and adjacent surfaces clean and free from all foulness. If desired, removable foot pieces, impervious or otherwise, may be provided for the foot receiving surfaces.\nIn order to drain or flush the feces receiving surface water or other iiushing medium may be supplied in any desired manner to any suitable form of flushing device. To render the closet thoroughly sanita I preferably em loy means whereby the c oset may be fiushe while in use, either by a constantly flowing stream of flushing medium or by automatlc or other means for flushing during use of the closet. When a flushing rim is employed, as herein shown, I referably provlde automatic means for ushing the surface, though it is obvious that a constantly flowing stream may be emlployed, and as a type of such iushin means ave herein shown a valve 13, pre erably located in a suitable valve casing 14;, preferably connected with the water entrance ipe 10, the valve stem being shown as exten ed upward and receiving upon the upper and prefer- 50' ably enlarged end 15 thereof the vertically movable valve operating member 16 whic may be provided at any suitable or convenient point, but which I have herein shown as located upon one of the foot supports, as having a de ending flan e 17 an as normally space above the oot support by a suitable coiled spring 18, surroundin the valve stem and normally acting to hol the valve in a closed ositlon. I ma employ any desired type o valve and may ocate the same at any suitable or desired point. In the described construction the iiushing will continue so long as the user maintains his position upon the foot su ports but if desired any other form of ius mg device, whether automatic or otherwise, may be employed and to that end in Fig. 3 is represented as a single ty ethereof,a iiushing tank 19, havnig a depen ing chain or other operating means 20 b which the iushing medium may be supp ied to the iushing rim 7 or in any other siutable manner to the feces receiving surface or any desired portion thereof. While the flushing medium may be applied to only a limited portion of the feces receiving surface yet I preferably supply the entire area of said surface therewith in order to kee the closet in a sanitary condition and to thls end the flushing rim is shown in Fig. 1 as entirely encircling thereceiving surface.\nIf desired, the water closet may be used also as a ,urinal and to that end any suitable urinary apparatus may be provided, but in this embodiment of the invention I contemplate the use of one wall of the closet for urinary purposes and (Figs. 2 and 3) have shown the wall 21 as adapted for that purpose, the same being preferably and as herein shown opposite the door 22 of the closet so that the user stands upon foot supports l1 and 12 and facing in an opposite 'dlrection to that assumed when using the closet as such. In order to facilitate the use of the device as a urinal when the latter is located as herein shown, the foot su ports 11 and 12 may be placed in pai-alle position instead of slightly diverglng as shown so as to adapt the same for convenient use for either purpose.\nIt is apparent that a urinal of the type shown or of any other desired type may be used independently of the closet, that is, that it is capable of general use as a urinal. In that type of urinal wherein a vertical wall is employed, as well as in that type of urinal known as the attached wall urinal, whereinabowl is suitably secured to a wall, it is a common practice to iiush or drain the wall or the bowl or attached wall type of urinal as by a horizontally dis osed pipe placed a suitable distance above t e lower edge of the wall or above the receiving surface of the bowl or attached wall type of urinal, from which water constantly flows down its urine receiving surface. Thls type of urinal is obj ectionable for 011e reason in that the iooring in the vicinity of the urinal becomes 'foul and unsanitary in spite of the iushinfr -referred to, the water employed for which is generally conducted off by a narrow trough at the base thereof. Again, urinals of every type are liable to become foul and unsanitary at the base thereof because of the lack of adequate liushing means. But especially and in order\" that a urinal of the bowl or attached wall t pe, or any other suitable type, may be t oroughly sanitary it is highly desirable that the surface thereof may e` wet with a flushing medium when used and that the urine be not received upon a dry surface. The after flushing of the used surface does not result in a sanitary `urmal. `and other ob `|ect1ons, and in order to render '10 overcome the above enumerated the urinal thoroughly sanitary, I herein not only flush the standing surface for the user of a urinal, or parts adjacent thereto, but I also flush the receiving surfaces of the urinal, of whatsoever type employed, in such a manner that the said surface is' wet with a flushing medium when the urine is received thereon, in contra-distinction to permittmg the urine to be received upon an otherwise dry surface which is afterward flushed. lIn the present embodiment of the invention I contemplate accomplishing this object by automatically flushlng the receiving surface of the urinal as the same is used. Thus in applyin my invention either to a urinal of the bow or attached wall type or to the type of urinal herein shown, I preferably not only Hush the urine receiving surface as the urinal is used, and preferably automatically through the foot of the user, but I preferably tlnsh the base or standing portlon for the user in the vicinity of the wall serving as a urinal or whereon the urinal is attached, preferably providing in the flushed area of the base or closely adjacent thereto suitable and preferably non-Hushed foot supports. By this arrangement the urinal and its surroundings are kept in a sanitary condition. In flushing adjacent surfaces, I Amay employ a constantly flowing stream of flushing medium, or may employ automatic or other means for flushing such surface or surfaces at intervals, but I have herein shown means for automatically iushing the same during use.\nIn the illustrated embodiment of my invention, the automatically controlled flushing pipe (Fig. 2)' leading to the flushing rim 9 has an upwardly leading extension having suitable connection with the horizontal perforated pipe 25 located at the front o the urine-receiving wall 21 so that the automatic iiushing of this surface at the time of its use is secured. It will be seen that, while this provides for the sanitary flushing of the urine-receiving wall while it is in use, the water is automatically shut olf at all times when the urinal is out of use.\nIf desired, the constant supplyA of flushing water referred to may be applied to the wall 21. through the tank supply pipe which latter is provided with a downturned portion (Fig. 3) connected to the perforated pipe 25 through the valve 23 by which it may be shut otl' or turned on as desired.\nThe closet is ireferably provided with four inclosing walls, as shown in Fig. 1, one of which is herein desi ed as a urinal, the wall 21 adapted for this purpose having an overlapping rim 24 either at its lower edge only or upon the sides also, to alord a sanitary connection between the same and the receiving portion thereof which in the presy Having thus described one type of embodiment of myinvention and the principles of use thereof, I wish it to be understood that although I have described the same specifically yet the descriptive terms are used in their generic sense and not as a matter of limitatlon and that the invention is set forth in the following claims.\nClaims:",

A composite back piece ill-is joined to the palm piece along its marginal edges partly by a welted seam l l and on the sides of the glove by integral leather portions, said pieces forming a thumb section l2 and a fingers section 13. As illustrated in Fig. 2 the composite back section is provided with the usual hand opening I4 and an adjustable strap l5. the margins of both being supplied with bound edges l6, saidback piece prejerably havin number of welted. seams l 'l extending from the bottom thereof up to, and meeting, thflwfilllfi seam 9 to secure together ajnumber of; forming sections.

'-Ihe front and back pieces may have the usual-ii ings, at least one of which is shown at 20 inFig's. 3 and 4 as a palm piece liner, it being understood that padding is disposed between the piece and liner in such areas and in the amounts necessary to form the desired glove contour.\nThe portions of the palm piece 1 and the back piece I0 which form the fingers section l3 of the glove are provided with two aligned and laterally spaced open-topped slots 2| and 22 which extend heightwise from the glove ball pocket 230 and open out into the upper edge of the said fingers section. The slot 2| is spaced inwardly from the adjacent side of the fingers section to form with the adjacent side a first finger stall 23 for the glove, whilst the remaining slot 22 is spaced inwardly from the opposite side of the fingers section to form a smallfinger stal1 24. The palm and back pieces extend solidly between the opentopped slots 2| and 22 to form an intermediate, dual fingers stal1 25-46 between the first and small finger stalls. The dual fingers stall 25-26 are disposed in side-by-side relationship and are joined together by solid web portions 21 and 28 of the palm and back sections I and I0, respectively.\nA row of vertically spaced, aligned openings 29 and 30 are formed in. the web portions of the palm and back pieces respectively, said rows extending from the glove ball pocket to a point adjacent the top of the glove. A dual fingers stall reenforcing thong 3| is interlaced and drawn through the aligned openings 29 and 3B in the respective palm and back pieces of the glove, and. as most clearly shown in Fig. 3, the interlacing of the thong follows the so-called saddler stitch\" wherein corresponding portions of the thong are drawn through opposite sides of each pair of consecutive openings in the row, the center portion of the thong being passed through the lowermost pair of holes therefor. As best shown in Fig. 2 one lateral branch 32 of the thong is laced through the upper end of the dual finger stall 26 and extends across the open- topped slot 22 so that it lashes the small finger stall 24 to the dual fingers stall.

    "description": "Ott. 11, 1960 F B SHAW ETAL 2,955,364\nCHALKBORDS Filed 0G12. 8, 1956 wear, solvents and corrosive chemicals.\nyCHALKBOARDS Fred B. Shaw, Bayside, and Jack S. Schlueter and John R. Guenther, Milwaukee, Wis., assignors to Continental Can Company, Inc., New York, N.Y., a corporation of New York Filed Oct. 8, 195'6, Ser. No. 614,47 9\n3 Claims. (Cl. 35-66) The present invention relates to a new and improved type of chalkboard formed from bibulous sheet material impregnated with a solid organic plastic. More particularly, the present invention is directed to the provision of an improved organic plastic chalkboard and process of forming the same, the chalkboard being made from polyester resins of a type to be described and provided with a polyester overlay surface portion which is internally reinforced by the inclusion therein of dispersed finely ground material.\nChalkboards are nowand have been primarily manufactured from slate, painted hardboard surfaces, opaque glass, and porcelain enameled metal.` Each of these basic types of chalkboards is objectionable in at least one respect either in connection with the manufacturing of the same or subsequent installation and use. Slate, for example, being limited to the well known black color, is somewhat limited in use due to its availability in only moderately sized sheets and, further, due to the difficulties encountered in installing the slate because of its relative fragility. Still further, slate, as in the case of all natural products, is quite variable in quality and this among other characteristics places slate in the category of expensive material. A\nPainted hardboard surfaces are readily prepared in any color and the manufacturing of the same is relatively simplied by use of a paint spraying process. Painted hardboard surfaces are inexpensive and readily available on the present market and, consequently, are widely used. While a good initial surface appearance can be obtained with this type of chalkboard, the surface is comparatively soft, as is common with many different types of painted surfaces, and consequently the painted hardboard surface has very limited resistance to Still further, various types of hardboard adapted for painting to provide a chank-retaining and eraseable surface are generally avaliable in sizes which are limited which restricts the usefulness of` this type of chalkboard.\nOpaque glass with one frosted face can also be made available in almost any color and is wear-resistant to a desirable extent. However, glass chalkboards of this type are limited in size, extremely expensive, fragile, and diliicult to install. Porcelain enameled steel with a matte surface exhibits substantially all of the Ydesirable characteristics of opaque glass while eliminating the undesirable characteristic of fragility. However, porcelain` enameling is an expensive process and has limited resistance to the action of corrosive chemicals.\nWith the advent and widespread use of organic plastics in `many different fields, efforts have been made to provide chalkboards molded or cast from thermoplastic resins lsuch -as polymethyl methacrylate for the purpose of improving on the physical and chemical properties of commercial forms of chalkboards. However, in the case of molded or cast thermoplastic resins ithas been found that themanufacture of chalkboards is overly exanstatt Fatented Oct. 1l, 1960 pensive and these boards are limited as to size and are further unsatisfactory in connection with resistance to this cure.\nwear and solvents. High pressure laminates have been tested in connection with their suitability for use as chalkboards but the principal problem confronting these latter efforts resides in the provision of a uniform, satisfactory writing surface. Still further, chalkboards manufactured in this manner are limited in sheet size due to press limitations.\nWith continued investigations made in the organic plastic resin field, continuous processes such as those disclosed in United States Patent No. 2,496,911 and United States Patent No. 2,528,152 have been found capable of producing organic plastic laminates which are unlimited in size. In continuously forming this type of laminate, polyester resins (hereinafter specified generally as polymerized polyhydric alcohol esters of unsaturated dibasic acids) have been utilized in the impregnating of the fibrous sheet material which is subsequently laminated in a continuous manner, the polyester resin being polymerized to a rigid or flexible thermoset structure without the evolution of any volatile by-product whatsoever. The outstanding characteristic of the polyester resins resides in the non-volatile polymerization step which makes continuous production of laminates possible. Without the presence of a volatile by-produ'ct it is unnecessary to apply pressure during the curing cycle such as is necessary in curing many other types of resins, as, for example, the phenolic, melamine and urea types. While it is `possible to manufacture continuous laminates or sheets from thermoplastic resins, such as the vinyls, polystyrene, methacrylates and cellulose acetate by extruding or coating with the molten polymer, these plastic materials are devoid of the surface hardness, wear resistance, dimensional stability, solvent and corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and permanency of the thermosetting resins such as the polyesters.\nA polyester resin for the purpose of the present invention is a complex product normally prepared by polymerizing the polyhydric alcohol esters of unsaturated dibasic acids. Typical polyhydric alcohols are ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerine, erythritol, pentaerythritol, butylene glycols, 'sorbitoL' and mannitol. Typical unsaturated dibasic acids are maleic, fumarie, and itaconic. The properties of these resins may be modified to obtain variations in ultimate properties by the use of substituted polyhydric alcohols and unsaturated dibasic acids (those in which one or more hydrogen atoms per molecule have been replaced with another element or an organic radical), and by the replacement of a portion of the unsaturated dibasic acids with saturated dibasic acids, such as phthalic, terephthalic, adipic, sebacic, and tetrachlorophthalic, or with chlorendic acid which, though unsaturated, behaves like a saturated compound with respect to polymerization. By these substitutions, resins which yield rigid, exible, lire-resistant or other properties may be obtained.\nResins of the type described may be either thermoplastic, as where the chain-like polymeric ester molecules are not connected to one another', or thermosetting, in the instance Where the chain-like polymeric polyester molecules are interconnected or crosslinked to one another. Commercial polyester resins are usually marketed in an incompletely polymerized form (liquid resin) by their manufacturers and users of these resins can then cure them by advancing the degree of polymerization in a laminating, casting or molding operation. As previously described, no volatile by-products result during Crosslinking the liquid polyester resin molecules by means of monomeric unsaturated molecules such as styrene, methyl styrene, vinyl acetate and methyl methacrylate impart good physical properties to the resin. Because of the generally better results obtained with styrene and the economic advantages inherent in its use, this crosslinking monomer is most commonly used. Consequently, the great majority of all commercially available liquid polyester resins are actually solutions of such resins in monomeric styrene.\nIn generally considering the continuous process of Patent No. 2,496,911, bibulous sheet material is impregnated with liquid organic plastic, such as a polyester resin, and any desired number of plies of the impregnated sheet material are brought together to form a laminate in a continuous manner. The sheet material used may include any natural or artificial material which exists in fibrous form to provide bibulous plastic reinforcement. Reinforcements of prime importance are natural kraft papers, bleached kraft papers, cotton linters and purified alpha cellulose papers. To be adapted for use in the continuous laminating process, the thicker core paper must preferably have better than average mechanical properties, be substantially uniform in caliper and composition, and have a pore structure that will allow for ready impregnation by the resin. The facing sheet may be pigmented or otherwise colored depending upon the desired color of the final product and such pigmentation is readily observable due to the transparency of the polyester resins. Once the desired laminate is formed, a nonbibulous sheet material is used to cover the exposed surfaces of the same so as to retain the shape of the laminated sheet during polymerization and, further, provide the exposed surfaces of the same with the type of finish desired. Polymerization is completed by the application of heat in any suitable manner such as disclosed in the above identified patent.\nIn using the continuous process it is possible to maintain a much closer tolerance in the over-all product as the material forming the product is passed through a set of combining rollers. Once a roll setting is made, the material is uniformly handled throughout any one continuous area. The resultant polyester laminate is readily adapted for many different uses. Such uses include insulation, building materials, luggage covering, advertising displays, etc. As the polyester resins contain no plasticizers, there is no volatile component to escape over a period of years, during the use of the laminate. Still further, due to the completion of polymerization and the presence of a thermoset state, subsequent change in the molecular structure does not take place and no change in physical properties are observable over an extended period of time. Polyester resin laminates are adapted to withstand elevated temperatures, are highly resistant to wear, and are resistant to a wide range of chemicals and food products.\nDue to the presence of the aforementioned desirable properties in polyester resin laminates, and, further, due to the adaptability of these laminates in being formed in a continuous manner thereby eliminating size restrictions, it has been found that by treating the polyester resin laminates in a manner to be described during the continuous formation thereof, a new and improved chalkboard can be continuously fabricated and formed. The chalkboard exhibits the necessary desirable physical and chemical characteristics of existing chalkboards while at the same time overcoming or not exhibiting the various undesirable features or limitations presently encountered in the manufacture and use of chalkboards.\nIt is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved organic plastic chalkboard formed from a polymerized polyester resin reinforced with fibrous sheet material, which chalkboard exhibits over-all composite properties of an improved and lasting nature.\nA further object is to provide a new and improved polyester resin chalkboard laminate having a resin over- 4 lay surface portion internally reinforced with nely ground material, the exposed face of the overlay surface portion being provided with a matte finish which is chalk-retaining while being readily eraseable.\nAnother object is to provide a chalkboard formed from polymerized polyester resin reinforced with bibulous material and being provided with a polymerized resin overlay surface portion exhibiting the desired chemical and physical properties of an appropriate chalk-retaining and eraseable surface, the reinforced polymerized resin chalkboard being adapted for manufacture in either rigid or flexible form and being further readily adapted for mounting on any desirable backing material.\nStill a further object is to provide a new and improved chalkboard formed from polymerized polyester resin laminate provided with a polymerized polyester resin overlay surface portion in which is dispersed finely ground glass and the writing face of which is provided with a flat, uniform, dull finish which is smooth to the touch and which diffuses refiected light uniformly to eliminate observable glare even at a low angle of refraction.\nAn additional object is to provide a process of forming a polyester resin chalkboard laminate which includes steps which can be continuously followed so as to provide uninterrupted operation in the forming of continuous sheets of chalkboard-forming material.\nOther objects not specifically set forth will become apparent from the following detailed description.\nIn the accompanying drawing,\nFigs. 1, 2 and 3 are enlarged diagrammatic sectional views of various forms of laminates of the types to be described.\nThe chalkboard of the present invention as previously described is formed from polymerized polyester resin which in its liquid state has been reinforced by one or more plies of bibulous sheet material and which further has been provided with an overlay surface portion of polyester resin throughout which has been dispersed finely ground reinforcing material. The writing face of the chalkboard, being the exposed surface of the overlay portion, provides a wear and abuse-resistant writing surface which is easily erased and which has minimum shine or glare, both as manufactured and after extended continuous use. This type of chalkboard is readily adapted for manufacture in a continuous manner as discussed above and as disclosed in the aforementioned patents. Consequently, any desired thickness of chalkboard may be produced and the chalkboard may be manufactured as either a rigid or resilient sheet in any desired color as will subsequently be described. Chalkboards of this type are readily backed up with relatively inexpensive material such as masonite, plywood, etc. to obtain the structural rigidity required in use. The chalkboard may be adhered to a backing in the factory and thus sold as mounted sheets or it may be applied to the backing at the site of installation so as to obtain the advantages of a continuous, joint-free writing surface.\nIn forming the chalkboard of the present invention any suitable process can be followed which will provide a reinforced polymerized polyester resin sheet provided with a polymerized polyester resin overlay having dispersed therein a quantity of finely ground reinforcing material such as glass. By referring to glass it is intended to cover an amorphous transparent or translucent brittle material usually made by fusion of silica, soda ash and salt cake or similar materials. Preferably, the continuous types of processes disclosed in the above identified patents are basically used so as to overcome restrictions as to sheet size while at the same time provide uniformity of product. One or more sheets of reinforcing or bulkproviding material, such as kraft paper, alpha cellulose paper or cotton linters, are impregnated with liquid polyester resin formulation. This formulation may be either a rigid type polyesters resin or a flexible type polyester resin depending upon the physical characteristics desired in the end product. The resin formulation will generally consist of a polyestervin styrene'solution and include a suitable polymerization catalyst such as a peroxide. The thickness of the end product Will depend primarily upon the number of plies of impregnated sheets used and impregnation of these sheets may be brought about in any suitable manner.\nAs an example of obtaining impregnation, each sheet may be continuously run through a body of liquid polyester resin formulation and subsequently joined together in face-to-face relation to form a laminate. Some of the sheets may be impregnated and joined with unimpregnated sheets, the excess polyester resin formulation functioning to impregnate the additional sheets combined thereby. This latter procedure is adapted for use where an extremely porous paper, such as cotton linters, is used as reinforcing paper. The impregnated reinforcing sheets are combined by the use of rollers and the thickness of the laminated plies are controlled by the setting of the rollers. Following the formation of the laminate, a surface of the same is passed through a portion of liquid polyester resin formulation which has dispersed throughout therein finely ground glass or anyother suitable reinforcing, abrasive material. Thus,` an o verlay surface portion which should not exceed 0L005 of an inch in thickness is applied to a surface of the uncured laminate, the thickness of the overlay portion being controlled by the passing of the treated laminate through a pair or pairs of rollers of a predetermined spaced setting.\nFig. l diagrammaticallyillustrates a laminate formed from a plurality of reinforcing plies 10, 11 and 12, the ply being a thin facing sheet of the type described in the examples below. The top surface of the laminate is provided with an overlay portion 13 having dispersed within the same finely ground particles of glass. Of course, in the illustration of Pig. l the thickness of the overlay 13 is exaggerated to better illustrate the formation of the chalkboard of the present invention.\nAt this stage of the process a non-bibulous covering material is used to cover both the top and bottom of the laminate so as to encase the'same during polymerization of the polyester'resin formulation. This arrangement is diagrammatically shown in Fig. 2 where sheets 14 and are used to cover the laminate. The non-bibulous encasing material in contactwith the exposed face of the overlay resin, such as the sheet 14 in Fig. 2, should be parchmentized paper capable of providing the overlay resin with a surface nish essentially identical to the writing surface finish desired on the chalkboard. The parchment used must have a uniform, matte surface, the degree of which is capable of providing a flat, uniform, dull surface on the overlay which feels smooth to the touch but diffuses reflected lightrso uniformly that no glare is apparent even at a low angle of refraction. The parchmentized'covering material ,is plasticized-las,` for example, with glycerine and water, and must separate or peel from the finished product following polymerization of the polyester resin formulation. This covering material m-ust also be essentially non-porous, be free of ropy areas, and have sufficient strength to carry the weight of the laminate through the ovens or other polymerization equipment. The parchmentized paper must obviously be easily wetted by the liquid resin in order to provide the degree of matte desired.\nFollowing encasing of the laminate, the entire assembly is carried o n tenter clamps through a series of progessively hotter ovens in the event that the process described in Patent No. 2,496,911 is followed. The cured laminate issuing from the terminal end of the oven is stripped of its encasing webs and either wound into rolls or sheared to desired sheet lengths. It may be passed through a sanding machine to roughen the back surface to make it more adaptable for cementing to a supporting surface with an adhesive which requires a roughened surface.\nIn the mounting of the laminate to a supporting base,\nany suitable type of adhesive may be used. Due to the uniformity of sheet manufacture and the provision of a completely fiat back surface, the laminated sheet may be readily applied to a substrate. Pressure is required only to maintain contact with the glue line and if the glue line has a pronounced initial grab, as in the case of contact adhesives, no special pressure is necessary. Following the gluing operation, any excess laminate sheet material overhanging the edges or cutouts of the substrate may be rapidly trimmed with a file. Arduous sawing often necessary in connection with the use of traditional chalkboard materials is thus entirely avoided. The laminate sheet when formed from flexible polyester resin formulations may be readily coiled thereby allowing self-edging and further adapting the laminate sheet for mounting on contoured surfaces. The polyester resin chalkboard may be adhered to plaster, wallboard, plywood, masonite, or any similar backing material either in wall-to-wall lengths or in segments, as desired.\nThe principal aspects of the chalkboard of the present invention reside in its adaptability for continuous manufacture and the presence of a unique surface which provides a wear and abuse-resistant writing surface that is easily erased and has minimum shine or glare, both as manufactured and after extended continuous use. `Such a surface is attained by the simultaneous use of a powdered-glass loaded overlay resin and a parchmentized paper of the correct texture. The presence of the dispersed powdered glass provides an improved wear resistance and resistance to gloss-up which is not found in known types of organic plastic chalkboards. Any suitable nely ground reinforcing material, such as glass, capable of providing the requisite physical properties may be used.\nThe following examples are illustrative of the organic plastic chalkboard and process of forming the same of the present invention and should not be construed as being limiting with respect thereto:\nExample l A continuous sheet of green pigmented alpha cellulose paper having a thickness of approximately 0.008 of an inch was continuously impregnated with a peroxide catalyzed rigid polyester resin formulation consisting of approximately 65% of a glycol phthalate maleate and approximately 35%, styrene. After a. period of approximately 24 hours at 70 F., the thoroughly impregnated paperwas placed on a continuous laminator and, after passing through one or more dip pans containing a similar resin formulation, was laminated with one or more plies of lkraft paper which had also been passed through the same resin formulation `for pre-impregnation thereby. The alpha cellulose paper formed the face sheet of the laminate which as illustrated in Fig. 1 is the ply 10. Immediately prior to the combining rolls effecting the lamination, an excess of the same polyester resin formulation filled with fine powdered glass of approximately 50 parts glass to parts resin was applied to the top surface of the green facing sheet. On passing through the combining rolls the overlay resin was evenly distributed at a uniform thickness of approximately 0.005 of an inch. Sirnultaneously, the entire laminate including the overlay portion was encased top and bottom in non-porous parchmentized paper of the type capable'of providing the face of the ovelay resin with a matte finish. The entire assembly was then carried on tenter clamps through a series of progressively hotter ovens in the manner described in Patent No. 2,496,911. Following polymerization the laminate was stripped of its covering material and was sheared to desired sheet lengths.\nExample 2 A facing sheet of solid black alpha cellulose paper having a thickness of approximately 0.004 of an inch was preimpregnated with a catalyzed resilient polyester resin 7 formation consisting approximately of 25% of a glycol phthalate maleate and 50% styrene modied by 25% of a glycol adipate maleate. The impregnated facing sheet was then laminated with a number of core sheets in the manner described in Example 1 with the exception that the powdered glass containing the overlay surface portion was formed from the same resilient resin formulation. Parchmentized paper was applied to the top portion of the laminate to thus provide the top encasingweb. The bottom encasing web was formed from glassine. Following polymerization as brought about in the same manner as described in Example 1, the parchmentized paper was stripped from the product and the glassine was removed by sanding.\nExample 3 Example 1 was repeated with the exception that the continuous process described in Patent No. 2,528,152 was followed. As described in this patent, a heated arcuate platen was used in completing polymerization of the polyester resin formulation. In using the heated platen the laminated sheet was run with the overlay portion and facing sheet in contact with the top surface of the platen, the encased laminate being slidably moved over the platen to provide the desired ironing action while being advanced by rollers which maintained uniform tension on the covering sheets to retain the same in rm sliding engagement with the arcuate platen.\nIn referring to the examples it will be noted that a pigmented facing sheet was used in forming the chalkboard. The polymerized polyester resins being transparent allow the use of pigmented facing sheets providing the chalkboard with any desired color. Thus the chalkboard formed in accordance with the principles of the present invention may be made in many different colors to further improve the appearance of the chalkboard as well as adapt the Same for varied uses. The glycol phthalate maleate is readily available commercially. Typical commercial resins are Selectron 5084 of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company and Paraplex P-43 of Rohm & Haas Company. This type of polyester resin is normally sold in a styrene solution of approximately 70% resin and 30% styrene. ditional styrene may be added as desired. The usual technique includes the addition of sufficient styrene to obtain a viscosity that works well with the particular reinforcements under impregnation. Such a viscosity falls generally within the range of about 200 to 1200 cps. The Viscosity of the overlay resin will preferably be higher, such as within the range of about 5,000 to 25,000 cps. With respect to the glycol adipate maleate, saturated dicarboxylic acids other than adipic may be used to attain a flexible resin, Paraplex P-13 of the Rohm & Haas Company is such a flexible polyester resin. In formulating the flexible polyester resin the amount of flexible resin added to the rigid resin will vary depending on the For optimum viscosity and rate of reaction adrelative liexibility desired. Generally, the amount of powdered glass used will fall within the range of about l5 to 100 parts for each 100 parts resin.\nIn place of the use of impregnated core material such as kraft paper, a non-bibulous rigid material such as masonite or plywood can be used. In this connection, the polyester resin overlay portion containing the disposed powdered glass and laminated to a colored face sheet 10 is laminated to the non-bibulous rigid material in following a modified continuous manufacturing process in forming the chalkboard. Such a product is diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 3 where the masonite base 16 is laminated with the face sheet 10 and overlay 17.\nUpon thorough testing of the chalkboards formed in the manner above described, it has been found that each product is provided with a good Writing surface of controllable color which is wear-resistant, solvent-resistant, resistant to corrosive chemicals, and non-fragile. The chalkboards are readily installed, available in continuous lengths and produceable at a moderate cost.\nObviously, many modifications and variations of the invention as hereinbefore set forth may be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, and therefore only such limitations should lbe imposed as are indicated in the appended claims.\nWe claim:",

MacDonald, Adrian, Mich, assignor to Cardinal of Adrian, Inc., a corporation of Michigan Original application Nov. 5, 1962, Ser. No. 235,217, new\nPatent No. 3,295,532, dated Sept. 14, 1965. Divided and this appiication Mar. 19, 1965, tier. No. 438,524\n7 Claims. (Cl. 16184) This invention relates to an improved hinge for latchless doors and more particularly to a hinge capable of urging a door toward and beyond its closed position so that the door remains securely closed without the necessity of employing a latch.\nHinges of the general nature with which the present invention is concerned are designed to keep a door tightly closed without any latch at all and are primarily used for small doors, such as for cabinets. To accomplish this, the hinge has a spring on one portion which contacts an engageable part on a second portion in such a manner that the door is urged beyond its normally-closed position. Hence, the door, when closed, is continuously urged against the door stop and a latch is not necessary. Elimination of the latch eliminates the cost of it and the cost of installation, which is often a time consuming procedure in order to align the latch components properly. Further, the latch components often become misaligned during changes in the weather, particularly during periods of high and low humidity, so that readjustment is periodically required. Misalignment also occurs during wear of the components and settlement of the building containing the door and door frame. Hinges of this nature also have the advantage of closing the door tightly without bouncing, even if it is slammed shut.\nThe latchless door hinge according to the invention has several advantages over those heretofore known. The new hinge is less expensive, having fewer components and less complicated ones. The new hinge also has increased closing power which is particularly advantageous for heavier doors, such as those for large cabinets. In addition, the hinges can be pre-assembled in order to reduce field labor rather than having to be assembled on the job site when the doors are hinged to the frames.\nIt is, therefore, a principal object of the invention to provide a latchless door hinge having the advantages outlined above.\nOther objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which:\nP16. 1 is a fragmentary plan View, with parts in cross section, of a cabinet, latchless door, and hinge embody ing the invention;\nFIG. 2 is an enlarged view in perspective of the hinge shown in FIG. 1, but in an open position;\nFIG. 3 is a plan view of the hinge shown in FIG. 2;\nFIG. 4 is a plan view of the hinge of FIGS. l3, in a closed position, with parts broken away and with parts in cross section;\nFIG. 5 is a detailed view in cross section taken along the line 5-5 of FIG. 3;\nFIG. 6 is a view similar to FIG. 1 but showing a further modified hinge;\nFIG. 7 is an enlarged view in perspective of the hinge shown in FIG. 6, but in an open position;\nFIG. 8 is a plan view of the hinge of FIG. 7, with parts broken away and with parts in section;\nFIG. 9 is a plan view of the hinge of FIGS. 6-8, in a closed position, with parts broken away and with parts in section; and\nFIG. 10 is a view in cross section taken along the line 10-10 of FIG. 7.\nReferring to FIGS. 1-5, a cabinet 68 includes side walls 70, a hinge frame member 72, and a door stop frame member 74 having a bumper 76. A door 77, of the overlay type in this instance, covers the cabinet opening and is hinged to the frame member 72 by a hinge 73 embodying the invention. The hinge 78 includes a first portion 80 and a second portion 82 pivotally connected thereto. The first portion 80 includes a back plate 84 having openings 86 to receive screws 88 which are turned into the hinge frame member 72 to affix the hinge 73 thereto. The first portion 8%) also includes an extension plate 90 having a pivot pin opening 92 (FIG. 5) at the outer end thereof to receive a pivot pin or rivet 94-. The opening 92 is larger than the pin 94 and is of non-circular shape to receive a non-circular projection 96 of a sleeve bearing 98. The bearing 98 has a flat surface rec (FIG. 4) forming an edge or engageable part 102.\nThe second portion 82 of the hinge 78 includes a back plate 104 having openings 1.06 and 108 to receive screws 11!) which are turned into the door 77 to afiix the hinge portion 32 thereto. The portion 82 also includes an extension plate 112 which extends past the upper or lower edge of the door '77, the edges being recessed for the extension 112, if desired. The extension 112 has an opening 114 near the outer end thereof to receive an end of the pivot rivet 94 which is then flared to form a permanent pivotal connection between the portions 89 and 82. The sleeve bearing 98 between the extensions 99 and 112 facilitates pivotal movement between them, the bearing 98 preferably being of a slippery plastic material such as Teflon or Delrin. The extension 112 has an upturned flange 116 along a diagonal edge thereof and an upturned retaining car 118 struck upwardly from the extension 112 and spaced from the flange 116. A spring rod 120 is held between the flange 116 and the car 118 with the free end of the rod 126 riding on the bearing 98. The bearing holds the rod 120 in a sprung position displaced from its normal or unsprung condition.\nWhen the door '77 is opened, the hinge 78 is in the position shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 with the free end of the spring rod 124) contacting the arcuate portion of the bearing 98 with the force of the spring rod 12% being directed through the pivot pin 94-. Hence, only a slight drag results and this is kept to a minimum because of the minimum friction between the rod 120 and the bearing 98.\nAs the door 77 is moved toward a closed position and forms an included angle of roughly 25 with the face of the cabinet 68, the spring rod 12% comes in contact with the part 102 of the bearing 98 and begins to exert a force to one side of the pivot pin 94 as it moves beyond a position tangential to the bearing 98 at the part 1652. The resulting torque urges the door toward the closed position and the torque remains even after the door is closed because the spring rod 12% still contacts only the part 1162, rather than the entire fiat surface 104). Hence, the force of the spring rod 1213 continues to act to one side of the pivot pin 94 and the door isurged past a closed position. The hinge 78 is preferably arranged so that the door would ordinarily move, if not restricted by the frame member 74, to a position approximately 3 (FIG. 4) beyond the closed position, although any angle from 2 to at least 10 is suitable.\nFrom the above discussion and description, it will be seen that the hinge is relatively uncomplicated and can be produced quite inexpensively. Further, the spring rod can be of almost any suitable size so as to produce a wide variation in force upon the engageable edge of the hinge member. It may also be noted that the spring can be fully assembled during the manufacture of the hinge so that the only field labor involved is attaching the back plate of the one hinge portion to the frame member and attaching the plate of the other hinge portion to the door.\nReferring to the modification of FIGS. 6-9, a cabinet 122 includes side walls 124, a hinge frame member 126, and a door stop frame member 128 having a door bumper 130. A door 132 again is of the overlay type and is pivotally attached to the hinge frame member 126 by a hinge 134. The hinge 134 includes a first portion 136 and a second portion 138 which are pivotally connected. The first portion 136 includes a back plate 140' having openings 142 to receive screws 144 for fastening the portion 136 to the inner surface of the frame member 126, in this instance. The back plate 140 also forms a groove 146 (FIG. which receives a spring rod 148 having a loop 150 affixed to the plate 14%) by a rivet 152. The groove 146 enables the rod 148 to be flush with the back surface of the plate 140 so that the plate 140 can fit flush against the hinge frame member 126. The back plate 140 also has an out-turned flange 154, part of which is bent outwardly to provide a plate extension 156. The end of the extension 156 has an opening 158 (FIG. 8) which receives a pivot rivet 161) similar to the rivet 94.\nThe hinge portion 138 includes a back plate 162 having elongate openings 164 to receive screws 166 to affix the back plate 162 to the inner surface of the door 132. The plate 162 also has an extension 168 bent therefrom with an opening 176 (FIG. 9) to receive a non-circular projection 172 of a sleeve bearing 174 to prevent rotation of the bearing 174 relative to the hinge portion 138. The bearing 174 lies between the extensions 156 and 168; it also is of an oily plastic material and has a flat surface 176 and an edge or engageable part 178. The spring rod 148 extends beyond the back plate 140 and is bent to one side so that it bears against the bearing 174 at all times and the bearing 174 holds it in a sprung position displaced from its normal or unsprung position.\nWhen the door 132 is open, as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the spring rod 148 contacts the arcu-ate surface of the bearing 174 and has no appreciable effect on the opening and closing of the door. However, when the door is moved toward the closed position and reaches an angle of roughly 25 30 to the front plane of the cabinet 122, the spring rod 148 contacts the part 178 of the bearing 174. As the outer portion of the spring rod 148 moves beyond a position tangential to the bearing 174 at the part 178, the force of the spring rod is directed to one side of the pivot pin 160, thereby producing a torque tending to move the door 132 beyond the closed position. Again, this force would be exerted until the door would reach a position about 3 beyond,\nthe closed one, with a position anywhere from 2 to at least 10 beyond the closed position being satisfactory.\nVarious modifications of the above described embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and it is to be understood that such modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention, if they are within the spirit and the tenor of the depending claims.\nI claim: p",

    "description": "Jan. 14 1969 A. l. w. FRANK CUP AND LID Filed April 26, 1967 ALAN l W FRANK IBNYVENTOR Hl$ ATTORNEY United States Patent Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE A cup and lid combination comprising a generally circular open-topped cup of resilient plastic material which cup adjacent its open top is generally conical with maximum transverse dimension at the open top and a lid of frangible material having a plug portion adapted to be forced down into the open top of the cup to tightly sealingly engage the inside surface of the cup and in so doing depress the resilient plastic material of the cup so that at least a part of the plug portion of the lid substantially interlocks with the cup, the lid having a hood portion embracing the cup rim and terminating outwardly of and below the cup rim with a tab projecting from the outer terminal edge of the hood portion which tab when pulled upwardly tears the material of the lid at opposite sides of the tab at least to the top of the hood portion, loosening the engagement between the cup and the lid, whereafter continued pulling upwardly of the tab removes the lid from the cup. The outer extremity of the hood portion of the lid constitutes a skirt extending generally downwardly but somewhat outwardly away from the cup with the tab projecting from the terminal edge of the skirt. The tab initially lies generally in a plane normal to the axis of the cup and lid. The lid has a generally centrally located upward projection or dome containing a vent hole, such upward projection being of irregular outline promoting damping of waves at the surface of liquid in the cup when the liquid-filled cup is being carried with consequent minimization of sloshing of liquid out through the vent hole. Such minimization of sloshing is further enhanced by proportioning the upward projection so that its depth is less than 2 /z% of the diameter of the lid and its maximum transverse dimension is less than of the diameter of the lid.\nThis invention relates to a cup and lid combination in which the lid tightly sealingly engages the cup so as to substantially interlock with the cup, the lid being provided with novel means for loosening the engagement between the cup and lid and facilitating removal of the lid from the cup. The invention also relates to a cup lid having an upward projection or dome containing a vent hole, such projection being of novel shape and dimensions minimizing sloshing of liquid out through the vent hole when a cup filled with liquid to which the lid is applied is being carried.\nWhile my invention is adaptable to cups and lids made of a variety of materials, I have found it to have exceptional utility when embodied in cups and lids of plastic material, especially when the cups are made of expandable polystyrene beads. The cups may be formed in a manner known to those skilled in the art by subjecting to heat and pressure expandable polystyrene beads impregnated with a blowing agent which under the application of heat causes the beads to expand. Cups thus formed are sufliciently deformable that When a cap is tightly applied an interlocking sealing engagement between cup and lid is produced. The lid is preferably made of relatively stiff but frangible plastic material and is provided with a tab which when pulled tears in controlled manner the ma- 'ice terial of the lid loosening its engagement with the cup and facilitating its removal.\nI provide a cup and lid combination comprising a generally circular open-topped cup of resilient plastic material which cup adjacent its open top is generally conical with maximum transverse dimension at the open top and a lid of frangible material having a plug portion adapted to be forced down into the open top of the cup to tightlysealingly engage the inside surface of the cup and in so doing depress the resilient plastic material of the cup so that at least a part of the plug portion of the lid substantially interlocks with the cup, the lid having a hood portion embracing the cup rim and terminating outwardly of and below the cup rim with a tab projecting from the outer terminal edge of the hood portion which tab when pulled upwardly tears the material of the lid at opposite sides of the tab at least to the top of the hood portion, loosening the engagement between the cup and the lid, whereafter continued pulling upwardly of the tab removes the lid from the cup. The outer extremity of the hood portion of the lid constitutes a skirt extending generally downwardly but somewhat outwardly away from the cup with the tab projecting from the terminal edge of the skirt. When the lid is applied to the cup the tab may lie generally in a plane normal to the axis of the cup and lid.\nI further provide a cup lid having a portion adapted to seal to a cup and a transverse body portion having a generally centrally located upward projection or dome containing a vent hole, such upward projection being of irregular outline promoting damping of waves at the surface of liquid in the cup when the liquid-filled cup is being carried with consequent minimization of sloshing of liquid out through the vent hole. The depth of the upward projection should be less than 2 /z% of the diameter of the lid and the maximum transverse dimension of the upward projection should be less than 15% of the diameter of the lid.\nOther details, objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent as the following description of a 4 present preferred embodiment thereof proceeds.\nIn the accompanying drawings I have shown a present preferred embodiment of the invention in which FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of a cup and lid combination in accordance with my invention;\nFIGURE 2 is a top plan view of the cup and lid combination shown in FIGURE 1;\nFIGURE 3 is a fragmentary view largely in central vertical cross-section 0n the line III-III of FIGURE 2 of the upper portion of my cup and lid combination;\nFIGURE 4 is an enlarged fragmentary perspective view of my cup and lid combination illustrating the first step in removal of the lid from the cup;\nFIGURE 5 is a fragmentary side elevational view of the cup and lid combination as shown in FIGURE 4;\nFIGURE 6 is a view similar to FIGURE 5 but showing the lid removed from the cup; and\nFIGURE 7 is an enlarged fragmentary cross-sectional view illustrating the interlocking relationship between the cup and lid when the lid is applied to the cup.\nReferring now more particularly to the drawings, there is shown a cup designated generally :by reference numeral 2 to which is applied a lid designated generally by reference numeral 3. In the form shown the cup is of circular frusto-conical form with a closed bottom and an open top, the cup being made of expandable polystyrene beads impregnated with a blowing agent as above described. The cup adjacent its open top is generally conical with maximum transverse dimension at the open top. The lid 3 is of relatively stiff but frangible plastic material. It has a plug portion 4 adapted to be forced down into the 3 open top of the cup to tightly sealingly engage the inside surface of the cup and in so doing depress the resilient plastic material of the cup so that at least a part of the plug portion of the lid substantially interlocks with the cup as shown at 5 in FIGURE 7. The lid has a hood portion 6 embracing the cup rim and exterminating outwardly of and below the cup rim. The outer extremity of the hood portion 6 of the lid constitutes a skirt extending generally downwardly but somewhat outwardly away from the cup with a tab 7 projecting from the terminal edge of the skirt. When the lid is applied to the cup the tab initially lies generally in a plane normal to the axis of the cup and lid.\nWhen the tab is pulled upwardly as illustrated in FIGURES 4 and 5 the material of the lid at opposite sides of the tab is torn in controlled manner as illustrated at 8 in FIGURE 4, such tearing extending at least to the top of the hood portion and normally terminating at that point as shown at 9 in FIGURE 4. Such tearing of the material of the lid loosens the engagement between the cup and the lid. Thereafter continued pulling upwardly of the tab removes the lid from the cup as illustrated in FIGURE 6. The tab normally remains connected with the lid along a line substantially at the top of the hood portion so that after tearing of the material of the lid as above described and illustrated in FIGURE 4 continued pulling upwardly of the tab causes the tab to somewhat change its orientation relatively to the lid as illustrated by comparison of FIGURES 5 and 6 and the lid separates from the cup.\nCentrally of the lid 3 is an upward projection 11 containing a vent hole 12. The upward projecttion 11 is of irregular outline promoting damping of waves at the surface of liquid in the cup when the liquid-filled cup is being carried with consequent minimization of sloshing of liquid out through the vent hole. In the form shown the upward projection or dome is in the form of the figure 6 which maybe an indication of the size of the lid and of the cup to which the lid may be applied. The irregular outline of the upward projection or dome interferes with or breaks up the wave action created when a cup full of liquid is being carried and importantly reduces sloshing of liquid out through the vent hole.\nThe upward projection or dome 11 is also dimensioned to further enhance the characteristic of the lid of minimizing sloshing of liquid out through th event hole. I have found that its depth should be less than 2 of the diameter of the lid. Also its maximum transverse dimension should be less that 15% of the diameter of the lid. Each of these factors contributes to minimization of sloshing of liquid out through the vent hole when a cup filled with liquid is being carried but optimum results accrue from the combination of the irregular outline of the upward projection or dome and the proportions above stated.\nMy cup and lid combination tightly confines the contents of the cup yet due to my novel lid construction the lid may easily be removed from the cup and sloshing of contents of the cup through the vent hole is minimized.\nWhile I have shown and described a present preferred embodiment of the invention it is to be distinctly understood that the invention is not limited thereto but may be otherwise variously embodied within the scope of the following claims.\nI claim:",

    "description": "Feb. 25, 1969 A P|RRELLO ET AL 3,429,423\nVIBRATORY BOWL Filed Aug. 25, 1967 7 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE This invention relates to a vibratory feed bowl apparatus adapted to feed chopped glass fibers and a powdered material at a -uniform rate to separate conveyor means. The vibratory feed bowl apparatus consists of an inner feed bowl wherein the powdered material is stored and a concentric outer feed bowl wherein the chopped glass fibers are stored. The upstanding cylindrical wall separating the inner and the outer bowl has a spiral helical track on the inner surface thereof which feeds the powdered material at a uniform rate and a spiral helical track on the outer surface which feeds the'chopped glass fibers at a uniform rate in a free-owing manner.\nThis invention relates to a vibratory feed bowl apparatus, and more particularly to a vibratory feeder bowl apparatus wherein a plurality of materials including chopped glass fibers and a powdered material are fed at a uniform rate to separate conveyor means.\nIn conventional manufacturing practice of glass fiber reinforced resins, it is often desirable to mix chopped glass fibers with a free-fiowing powdered material such as polystyrene prior to adding the fiber mixture to a screw-type extruder. In order to do this effectively, the chopped glass fibers and the polystyrene powder should be fed into the extruder in a free-flowing condition and at a controlled uniform rate. Conventional vibratory feeders of the type to `which the present invention relate comprise feeding bowls which are mounted on or otherwise connected to a vibration creating mechanism. A helical track is formed along the inner periphery of the bowl and leads from the bottom of the bowl to an exit port at the top of the bowl. The material is placed in the bottom of the bowl and the free-flowing powdered material is driven upward on the track by the vibration.\nVibratory `bowls of the type described do not function satisfactorily with chopped glass fibers due to the tendency of glass fibers to build up a fiber mass large enough to stop the upward fiow of the glass fiber on the track. The chopped glass fibers form a stationary fiber mass in the conventional vibratory bowl because of the formation of a stationary chopped glass fiber mass is caused by the centrifugal forces at work during the operation of a vibratory feeding apparatus. The centrifugal forces cause the chopped glass fibers to gradually move outwardly toward the wall of the bowl. Since the wall prevents all further outward movement, in time sutiicient glass fibers pile up near the wall to form a mass that is interlocked to such an extent that the vibrational forces are no longer effective in moving the liber mass near the wall up the track. Once the fiber mass build-up begins, the size of the mass grows as more glass fibers move up the track and reach the congested area. Prior to this invention, vibratory bowl feeders did not satisfactorily move chopped glass fibers in a continuous freefiowing stream from the bottom of the bowl to the receiving means at the top of the bowl for any considerable length of time.\nAccurate control of feeding chopped glass at a uniform rate has been heretofore this invention a problem in nited States atem ICC making chopped glass fiber-powder mixtures. Previous methods which require individual control of both the chopped glass and the powder material feed rates were very sensitive to small changes in the feed rate of either component there-by making accurate control difficult. It has also been a problem to deliver a sufiicient quantity of chopped glass fiber in a feeding apparatus to form a high chopped glass fiber to powdered material ratio for manufacturing processes.\nIt is the primary object of this invention to provide a vibratory feeder which feeds chopped glass fibers continuously in a free-flowing manner at a uniform rate to the receiving means. It is another object of this invention to provide a single vibratory feeder wherein chopped glass fibers and a powdered material can be fed simultaneously into separate conveyor means. It is still another object of this invention to provide an improved vibratory feeder wherein chopped glass fibers and a powdered material can be fed simultaneously into separate conveyor means at a controlled ratio and at a controlled rate. It is yet another object of this invention to provide an improved vibratory feeder device wherein the chopped glass fibers can be fed at a sufficiently high rate together with a powdered material so that a high chopped glass fiber-to-powdered material ratio can be obtained.\nThese and other obpects are accomplished by a multiple bowl vibratory feeder having an outer feed bowl concentrically mounted about an inner feed bowl. The two vibrating bowls are separated by an upstanding cylindrical lwall. The cylindrical wall lhas an upwardly extending spiral trackway on the inner surface thereof adapted to carry powdered material from the inner bowl upwardly to conveyor means located at the top thereof. The cylindirical wall has an upwardly extending spiral trackway on the outer surface thereof adapted to carry chopped glass fibers from the outer bowl upwardly to separate receiving means located thereabove. During the operation of the vibratory feeder the chopped glass fibers move up the spiral trackway on the outer surface of the cylindrical walls in a free-fiowing manner. The chopped glass fibers do not pile up in a mass sufficient to stop the free-iiowing movement lthereof at the outer edge of the spiral track since as these chopped fibers pile up at the outea edge, they fall over the edge of the track which has a low retaining wall back into the bottom of the ibowl. By preventing the chopped glass fibers from building up to a level which causes a stationary mass, a free-flowing and uniform movement of the chopped glass fibers is insured. The vibratory forces drive an excess of chopped glass fibers and a powdered material to the top of the spiral tracks. At the top of the spiral tracks adjustable baffle means ldivert the excess chopped glass fibers back into the outer bowl and the excess powdered material back into the inner bowl so that only the desired quantities of each are delivered at a uniform rate to the separate conveyor means.\nOther objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description, reference being maide to the accompanying drawings wherein the preferred embodiment of this invention is shown.\nIn the drawings:\nFIGURE 1 is a side view of the vibratory feeder bowl apparatus partly in cross section and partly in elevation; and\nFIGURE 2 is an end view of the vibratory feeder bowl apparatus.\nReferring now to FIGURE l, a conventional vibrator 10 `which can be driven electrically or mechanically is supported on a base 12` that together with the vibrator 10 forms the vibrating mechanism. A commercially available vibrator unit, Syntron EB-3, works satisfactorily as the vibrator 10. Other vibratory units which are larger or smaller may be used depending upon the quantity of material which is to be moved. The bottom 14 of a cylindrical shaped outer feed bowl 16 is flxcdly secured to the upper plate 17 of the IVibrator 10 by conventional means, such as welding. An inner feed bowl 18 is concentrically mounted within the outer feed Ibowl 16. The oylindrical wall 20 of the inner feed bowl 18 is ilxedly secured to the bottom 14 of the outer feed bowl 16 by con-yentional means, such :as welding. In this manner actuation of the vibration mechanism causes similar vibration of the inner feed bowl 18 and the outer feed Ibowl 16.\nA spiral trackway 22 on the inner surface of the upstanding cylindrical lwall 20 extends upwardly from the bottom 21 of the inner feed bowl 18 to an exit port 24 at the top of wall 20. Conveyor means 26 in the form of a track extension or the like is connected to the spiral trackway 22 at the exit port 24. As shown in FIGURE 2, a baille member 28 is associated with the trackway 22 at exit port 24 to displace the excess powdered material. The baille member 28 directs the excess powdered lmaterial to fall from the trackway 22 to the bottom 21 of the inner feed bowl 18. The spiral track 22 has a retaining wall 30 in the form of a vertical flange at the outer edge thereof. The height of the retaining wall 30 and the width of the track 22 determine the quantity of the powdered material which is conveyed up to the Ibaffle member 28. The height of the - wall 30 and the width of the track 22 are not critical. The wider the track 22 and the higher the wall 30, the larger the quantity of powdered material that is conveyed upward.\nA spiral trackway 32 on the outer surface of the upstanding cylindrical wall 20 extends upwardly from the bottom 14 of the outer feed bowl 16 to an exit port 34 near the top of the wall 20. Conveyor means 36 in the form of a track extension or the like is connected to the spiral trackway 32 at the exit port 34. A baille member 37 is associated with the tracleway 32 at the exit port 34 to displace the excess chopped glass fibers. The baflle member 37 directs the excess chopped glass fibers to fall from the trackway 32 to the bottom 14 of the outer feed bowl 16. Spiral trackway 32 has a vertical retaining member 38 in the form of a vertical ilange. The width of the track 32 and the height of the vertical retaining member 38 determines the quantity of chopped glass fibers which is conveyed up to the baille member 37. The width of the track 32 is not critical. In the prefenred embodiment the iwidth of the trackway 32 is about 2 to 3 inches. The height of tlhe vertical flange 38 is critical since it prevents the fibers from building up to a level at which the fibers would no longer move up the track in a free-flowing movement. Chopped glass fibers which reach a certain height are no longer moved by vibration and tend to cause the Yfibers at a lower level to build up and block the trackway. rllhe height of the vertical flange 38 ranges from about 1A to 3%; inch. Heights of the flange 38 higher than 5X1 inch are not desirable because the chopped fiber mass has a tendency to back up and stop moving upward on the track. In addition to not ilowing freely, chopped glass masses of this size are not readily mixable with other powdered materials since this mass has a tendency to remain in a clump. Experiments show that chopped glass fibers lmove in a free-flowing state up a track 2 inches wide having a vertical retaining member 3/8 of :an inch high. Similar desirable results are obtained on a track 3 inches wide where the vertical retaining member is 3/4 of an inch high.\nIn operation, a quantity of chopped glass fibers is placed in the outer bowl 16 and a quantity of powdered material such as polystyrene powder is placed in the inner bowl 18. Activation of the vibrator 10 causes the powdered material to move up the spiral trackway 22 from the bottom of the inner bowl 18 to the top of the cylindrical rwall 20 in a conventional manner. The width of the track 22 and the height of the vertical flange 30 are designed so that an excess of powdered material is delivered to the baille member 2S which diverts the excess of the powdered material off of the track so that it falls to the bottom of the inner bowl 18. The desired quantity of powdered material passes through the exit port 24 to the conveyor means 26.\nActivation of the vibrator 10 causes the chopped glass fibers to move from the bottom of the outer bowl 16 up the spiral trackway 32 up to baille member 37. As the chopped glass fibers move on the trackway 32 they have a tendency to move outwardly on the trackway 32 toward the retaining member 38 and the height of the chopped glass fiber as a result is higher near the flange 38 than elsewhere on the track. Chopped glass 4fibers which reach a height somewhat higher than that of the flange move over the top of the flange 38 and fall back to the bottom of the outer bowl 16. The chopped glass fibers must be placed on the outer bowl 16 and driven up the spiral trackway 32 which is mounted on the outer surface of the cylindrical walls so that the height of the chopped glass fibers does not reach a level which Iwould cause the bers to block up and stop moving in a free-flowing state.\nIt has been observed that the use of the inner bowl 18 -with the spiral track 22 mounted on the inner surface of the cylindrical wall is not suitable for the practice of this invention since in this case the chopped glass fibers tend to move toward the cylindrical wall until a glass liber height is reached which causes the free-flowing movement of the chopped glass fibers to stop.\nThe width of the track 32 is designed so that an excess of chopped glass bers is delivered to the baille member 37 which diverts the excess of the chopped glass fibers off of the track so that it falls to the bottom of the outer bowl 16. The desired quantity of chopped glass fibers passes through the exit port 34 to the conveyor means 36.\nThis vibratory bowl apparatus is particularly Well suited for forming chopped glass fiber-polymer powder mixtures containing up to 40 weight percent glass. The use of this vibratory feeder in a method for preparing chopped glass ber-polystyrene molded parts is fully described in copending patent application Ser. No. 663,334.\nWhat is claimed is:",

The flint is clamped endwise between the slide and 431/276 the periphery of the rotary flint wheel. The slide is retractable F23q 1/06 to allow easy removal and replacement of the flint and is Field of Search 431/254, latched in the retracted position by a cooperating detent ele- 273-277 ment on the spring-loaded lid of the lighter.\na l-- j 5-5 l l r r- 9 a e \\ l 5 4 POCKET LIGHTER It is well known in pocket cigarette lighters to press the igniting flint against the flint wheel by utilizing the force of a helical spring whose tension can be preloaded and adjusted by a coaxial setscrew. By removing the small screw and the spring, flint replacement is made possible. An important disadvantage of this conventional arrangement is that the coil spring is not capable of exerting a relatively constant force on the flint as variations in spring loading due to gradual wearing of the flint take place. That is to say, when a new flint is employed, the coil spring will be rather fully compressed and will exert a considerable force against the flint. When the flint is worn and the spring expands, its tension and force drop considerably and this in turn results in poor sparking and poor lighting results. If the spring tension is increased by turning the screw to compensate for the worn flint, this inevitably will cause overloading of the spring when used with an unworn flint, so that the flint wheel can only be turned with difficulty or not at all and still further adjustment of the screw must be made. Ordinarily, the spring must be arranged horizontally and is extremely short because of the mechanical layout of the lighter, which in turn is a reason for the great variation in force between an unworn flint and a worn flint backed up by the coil spring. Also, when the adjusting screw is removed for replacement of the flint, the small coil spring has a tendency to pop out and to become lost.\nThe objective of this invention is to eliminate all of the above prior art problems by the provision of a much more efflcient and convenient flint-loading mechanism in a pocket lighter. The mechanism employs a form of spring which is capable of exerting a relatively constant force on the flint regardless of whether the flint is worn or unworn and the need for the tension-adjusting screw is completely eliminated. The mechanism also embodies a simple slide backed up by the constant tension spring, and the slide abuts one end of the flint and presses the opposite end of the flint against the flint wheel. Manual retraction of the slide permits easy replacement of the worn flint without the necessity for any flint spring adjustment. The slide and the pivoted spring-loaded lid of the lighter have cooperating latch parts which hold the slide in the retracted position until the lid is closed. Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent during the course of the following description.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING FIGURES FIG. 1 is a fragmentary vertical section through a pocket lighter with the lid closed and a spring-loaded flint inserted in the normal position, conventional parts being omitted for simplicity.\nFIG. 2 is a similar sectional view of the lighter with the lid open and the flint-engaging slide retracted and latched, the flint being shown in a partly inserted position.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring to the drawings in detail wherein like numerals designate like parts, the numeral 1 designates the body or housing of a lighter having a lid 3 hinged thereto on a cross pin 2 near the top of the lighter and in the housing. From the lid 3, an arm extension 4 projects inwardly, at the end of which an integral detent or latching lug 5 is provided, as shown.\nThe arm extension 4 possesses a journal 6 moving therewith which is engaged by the forked end of a telescopic spring housing 7 shown in broken lines containing a compressible lid The flint 13 is normally disposed horizontally with one end thereof bearing frictionally against the periphery of the flint wheel II and its other end abutting a lug l5 ofa reciprocatory slide I6 having a downward extension or foot 17 which engages and is guided by horizontal housing shoulders 18 in its movement. The upper broader head of the slide 16 engages and is guided by a top plane surface 19 of the housing. The head of the slide 16 possesses a forward thumb rest 20, to the rear of which a latching lug 21 or detent part extends downwardly, as shown, for a purpose to be described.\nCentrally within the housing 1, a torsion spring 23 has its coils supported on a fixed pin 22 and this spring is provided with one straight arm 24 bearing against a fixed pin 26 in the housing and an angled arm 25 whose terminal end engages in a locating groove 27 formed in the rear vertical wall of the slide 16. The type of spring employed is capable of exerting a nearly constant pressure against the flint l3 regardless of the length of the flint as wear occurs. That is to say, there is very little difference between the spring pressure exerted on an unworn flint as compared to a worn flint needing replacement. This eliminates the necessity for a spring tension adjustment and renders the flint wheel easy to operate at all times. When the lid 3 is closed, as in FIG. 1, the spring arm 25 continually urges the slide 16 into clamping engagement with the flint 13 and holds it firmly in contact with the flint wheel 11 with a substantially constant or even force which does not vary appreciably when the flint wears, as stated.\nWhen it is desired to replace the worn flint 13, the lid 3 is opened, as in FIG. 2, and the coil spring 8 will then bias the lid in the open position, as the journal 6 swings to the other side of the hinge or pivot element 2. The slide 16 is now retracted from the flint by placing the finger on the thumb rest 20 and the latching lug 21 of the slide will engage and lock behind the lug 5, as shown in FIG. 2, slightly above the pin 2. The spring 8 will yield slightly to permit this interlocking engagement of the detent means. The opening 14 is now fully exposed and the worn flint can be easily removed and a new flint introduced into the lighter as depicted in FIG. 2.\nUpon reclosing the lid 3, the tooth or lug 5 automatically releases the slide 16 and the spring arm 25 exercises its full force on the slide I6 and returns the slide to the normal flint holding position shown in FIG. 1.\nIt is believed that the simplicity, compactness and efficiency of operation of the invention will now be fully appreciated without further description. It is to be understood that the form of the invention herewith shown and described is to be taken as preferred example, and that various changes in the shape, size and arrangement of parts may be resorted to, without departing from the spirit of the invention.\nlclaim:",

The hinge includes a first hinge leaf attached-to the door and a second hinge leaf attached to the wall of the cabinet. The second leaf includes a generally planar rearward portion which lies against the side of the cabinet wall and provides a pair of attaching tabs which are inserted into perforated shelf-support strips carried by the wall. The forward portion of the second hinge leaf is generally L-shaped and includes an intermediate portion which lies against the front of the cabinet wall. The front of the wall is provided with a vertically extending slot, and a rearwardly extending projection on the forward portion is received by the slot.\nsum 1 OF 2 FIG. 10\nINV Hammond A. Berry Michael J. Duly i BY au/rzmv, JJZbn/ 7 1K and 2 ATTORNEYS ENT( )RS CABINET HINGE BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY A particular cabinet may at times be used with doors to close the front thereof, and at other times it may be desirable to remove the doors toexpose the shelves of the cabinets. Accordingly, it is desirable that the doors be readily attachable to and removable from the cabinet. When the doors are used, they should be securely supported by the cabinet, and when the doors are removed, no unsightly screw holes or other defects in the cabinet walls should be visible.\nThe inventive hinge quickly and easily attaches a door to a cabinet wall without requiring unsightly screw holes or the like which would be visible when the door is removed. One of the hinge leaves is secured to the door, and the other leaf is firmly attached to the cabinet wall by tabs which are received in the openings of a perforated shelf-support strip attached to the wall and by a projection which is received by a decorative slot provided in the front of the wall. The second leaf is held squarely against the cabinet wall, providing a secure attachment of the door to the cabinet. The hinge may be readily disengaged from the'cabinet wall merely by prying the tabs from the perforated strip.\n1 DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a typical cabinet with several adjustable shelves;\nFIG. 2 shows the cabinet of FIG. 1 with doors attached;\nFIG. 3 is an enlarged fragmentary perspective view of one of the cabinet hinges shown in FIG. 2;\nFIG. 4 is a fragmentary sectional view taken along the line 4-4 of FIG. 3;\nFIG. 5 is a view similar to FIG; 4 with the doors swung open 180;\nFIG. 6 is a view similar to FIGS. 4 and 5 with the door swung open 180;\nFIG. 7 is a fragmentary sectional view of the center panel of a double cabinet with the left door closed and the right door swung open I80;\nFIG. 8 is a fragmentary perspective view looking into the cabinet with the doors open 180\";\nFIG. 9 is a vertical sectional view of the rearward portion of the hinge;\nFIG. 10 is a perspective view of the hinge;\nFIG. 11 is a top view showing the hinge attached to the cabinet with the cabinet wall partially broken away;\nFIG. 12 is a fragmentary perspective view similar to FIG. 8 of a modified hinge;\nFIG. 13 is a perspective view of the hinge of FIG. 12;\nFIG. 14 is a top view of the hinge of FIG. 12; FIG. 15 is a top view similar to FIG. 14 of another modification of the hinge;\nFIG. 16 is a fragmentary perspective view of the hinge illustrated in FIG. 15; and\nFIG. 17 is a perspective view of the hinge illustrated in FIG. 16.\nDESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENT Referring to FIG. 1, the numeral 20 designates generally a cabinet having right and left sidewalls 21 and 22, respectively, and several shelves 23. The shelves 23 are supported by conventional perforated shelf- support strips 24 which are attached to the sidewalls 21 and 22, and the height of the shelves 23 may be adjusted in the usual manner by changing the position of the shelves with respect to the vertically extending strips 24. Referring to FIG. 2, the cabinet 20 may be provided with right and left hand doors 25 and 26, respectively, and each door is attached to the cabinet by a pair of hinges 27.\nAs can be seen best in FIGS. 3 and 8, the cabinet wall 22 includes an outer side 28, an inner side 29, and a front side 30. The front side is provided with a vertically extending slot or groove 31 which is generally Ushaped to provide a pair of forwardly extending, spaced- apart ribs 32.\nThe inner side 29 of the cabinet wall 22 may be recessed as at 33 (FIGS. 4 and 8) so that the generally channel-shaped shelf- support strip 24 may be attached to the cabinet wall to lie flush with the inner side 29. As is well known, the conventional shelf support strips 24 are provided with spaced-apart perforations or slots 34 which receive suitable brackets to support the shelves.\nThe hinge 27 includes a pair of hinge leaves 35 and 36 and a barrel 37. Referring to FIG. 10, hinge leaf 36 includes two spaced barrel segments 37a which are interleaved with spaced barrel segments 37b on the leaf 35, and the leaves are rotatably joined by a conventional hinge bolt which passes through the barrel segments. The top and! bottom of the barrel 37 are rounded as at 33 to reduce the chance of the hinge snagging on clothes or the like.\nThe hinge leaf 36 includes a generally rectangular and planar rearward portion 39 and a forward portion 40 which is generally L-shaped in horizontal cross section. The rearward portion 39 extends along the inner side 29 of the cabinet wall and is held thereagainst by attaching tabs 41 which project generally perpendicularly from the rearward portion and are received by the perforations 34 of the shelf-support strip. The L-shaped forward portion 40 includes an intermediate portion 42 which extends generally perpendicularly from the rearward portion 39 across the front of one of the ribs 32 of the cabinet wall, and an end portion 43 which extends forwardly from the intermediate portion generally parallel with the rearward portion 39. The end portion 43 is laterally offset from the rearward portion 39 by the intermediate portion 42 a distance approximately equal to the thickness of the rib 32, and a projection or tongue 44 is punched out of the end portion 43 and bent rearwardly into the groove 31. The tongue 44 extends rearwardly generally parallel with the rearward portion 39, and the distance between the tongue 44 and rearward portion e 39 is approximately equal to the thickness of the rib 32. The\nlength of the tongue 44 in the vertical direction is approximately half of the total vertical dimension of the hinge, and the tongue provides a substantial gripping surface against the rib 32.\nThe hinge leaf 35 is attached to the side edge 45 of the door 26 in the conventional manner. The leaf 35 is provided with three countersunk holes for flat or oval head screws 46 which secure the leaf to the door. If desired, the rearward portion 39 of the leaf 36 may be provided with a countersunk opening or slot 47 aligned with the attaching tabs 41 to receive a screw 48 to hold the hinge even more securely against the cabinet wall. The screw 48 may be threaded either into one of the perforations 34 or into a screw hole 49 provided in the shelf-support strip between a pair of adjacent perforations.\nAs can be seen best in FIG. 9, the attaching tabs 41 extend generally transversely from the rearward portion 39 and are generally arcuately shaped to curve away from each other. Each of the arcuate tabs provides a valley or groove 41a adjacent the rearward portion 39 and curve toward each other at 4112. The distance between the grooves 41a of the upper and lower attaching tabs is greater than the distance between the curved portions 41b and corresponds to the minimum distance between five of the perforations 34 and the shelf-support strip. When the attaching tabs 41 are inserted into the perforations, the rounded portions 41b of the somewhat resilient attaching tabs first flex or spread apart to allow the attaching tabs to enter the perforations and then return to their original positions to hold the hinge securely against the cabinet wall. It has been found that making the hinge of cold rolled steel of approximately 0.072 inch thickness provides the desired flexibility and resilience. The outer ends of the attaching tabs 41 are seen to curve away from each other as at 410 to facilitate the spreading of the tabs as they are inserted into the perforatrons.\nReferring to FIGS. 46, the end portion 40 of the hinge leaf 36 is slightly longer in the horizontal direction than the hinge leaf 35 and the barrel 37 of the hinge is positioned outwardly from the intermediate portion 42 a sufficient distance to permit the door 26 to be swung inwardly into perpendicular relationship with the cabinet wall -22. As illustrated, the door 26 may freely rotate 180 from the closed position illustrated in FIG. 4 to the fully opened position illustrated in FIG. 6. Further, a gain or recess need not be cut into the door to receive the hinge leaf 35.\nFIG. 7 illustrates the use of the hinges with a center post 22' of a cabinet. The center post 22' is similar to the cabinet wall 22 but supports shelves 23 and 23 extending from both sides of the center wall. The shelf 23 is supported by shelf- support strip 24, and the shelf 23' is supported by the shelf-support strip 24'. A hinge 27' is attached to the left side of the center wall 24' in a manner similar to the hinge 27, but the hinge 27' is attached in an inverted position with respect to the hinge 27. The end portion 40 of the hinge leaf 36 positions the barrel 37 outwardly a sufficient distance to permit the door 26 to swing a full 180 to overlie the door 26 attached to the hinge 27'.\nWhen it is desired to remove the hinges, a screwdriver or the like may be slipped between the rearward portion 39 and the shelf-support strip, and the attaching tabs 41 may be pried from the perforations. The hinges may be removed quickly and easily, and once removed, no unsightly holes or defects appear in the cabinet. Similarly, the hinges may be easily attached merely by inserting the tongue 44 into the groove 31 and pushing the attaching tabs 41 into the perforations in the shelf-support strip. The rib 32 of the wall is gripped between the tongue 44 and the rearward portion 39 of the hinge, and the tabs 41 hold the intermediate portion 42 squarely against the front of the rib, thereby securing the hinge against movement in any direction. The tabs 41 lie along a line parallel with the barrel 37 and the length of the intermediate portion 42, and the barrel is held in a vertical position.\nReferring to FIGS. l214, a modified hinge 127 similarly includes hinge leaves 135 and 136 rotatably joined at the barrel 137. The hinge leaf 135 is attached to the door 126 by screws 146 as described hereinbefore with respect to the hinge 27. The hinge 127 includes a rearward portion 139, an intermediate portion 142, and an end portion 143, but rather than a single projection which is received by the groove 131 in the cabinet wall 122, the leaf 136 includes a pair of projections 144. Further, the projections 144 are punched and bent out from the intermediate portion 142 rather than the end portion 143.\nAttaching tabs 141 extend from the top and bottom of the rearward end of the portion 139, and the attaching tabs 141 have the same shape as the tabs 41 previously discussed. However, the distance between the tabs 141 is equal to the minimum distance between four perforations 134 of the shelfsupport strip 124 rather than five perforations. A pair of screw holes 147 are provided in the rearward portion 139 aligned with the attaching tabs 141, and two round head screws 148 may be inserted through the holes into perforations 134.\nAnother modification of the hinge is illustrated in FIGS. l17. The hinge 227 is designed for use with shelf- support strips 224 which are not recessed into the cabinet wall 222. The advantage of this modification is that the hinge can be used to attach a door to a cabinet which did not previously have shelf-support strips. The hinge 227 is similar to the hinge 127, but the rearward portion 239 includes a laterally offset end portion 2390 which extends parallel to the major portion of the rearward portion 239 and is offset therefrom by shoulder 239k which extends laterally outwardly from the wall. The depth of the shoulder 23% is approximately the same as the horizontal dimension of the channel-shaped shelfsupport strip 224, and the attaching tabs 241 which extend from the offset portion 239a hold the rearward portion 239 securely against the cabinet wall 222. The screws 248 may be used to provide a more secure attachment. The leaf 235 is similarly attached to the door 226 by screws 246.\nIf desired, the rear edge of the rearward portion of the cabinet hinge can be provided with an emboss or a bulge which extends away from the shelf-support strip to permit a screwdriver or other prying tool to be more readily inserted between the shelf-sup ort strip and the cabinet hinge. Further, if a pair of hinges are 0 beused on opposite sides of a cabinet wall, as, for example, in FIG. 7, we have found it desirable to use only a single screw hole in the rearward portion of the hinge. For example, with the hinge illustrated in FIG. 12, only the upper or the lower hole 147 need be used, and, since the brackets on opposite sides of the cabinet wall illustrated in FIG. 7 are upside down with respect to each other, there is no chance that the single screw inserted into each hinge will interfere with the screw for the other hinge.\nWhile in the foregoing specification, detailed descriptions of specific embodiments were set forth for the purpose of illustration, it is to be understood that many of the details hereingiven may be varied considerably by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of our invention.\nWe claim:",

BARGAR, a citizen of the United States, residing at Oarbondale, in the county of Lackawanna and State of Pennsylvania, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in N ail-Holding Devices; and I do declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, such as will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same, reference being bad to the accompanying drawings, and to the letters of reference marked thereon, which form a part of this specification.\nThis invention relates to new and useful improvements in devices for holding nails to hammer-heads while being driven; and it consists in the provision of means whereby the head of the nail may be held adjacent to the head of the hammer and at right angles to the striking-face thereof, whereby the nail may be started by giving the latter a light blow with the side of the head of the hammer, after which the nail is released from the notch holding the same, and the nail may then be driven with the striking-face of the hammer.\nMore specifically, the present invention consists in the provision of a nail-holding device consisting of a piece of wire which is bent and formed into a V-shaped portion designed to receive the head of the nail, thence said wire being bent or coiled to form two loops, through which short rods are passed, the shank portions of the wire thence bent at substantially right angles to the portion containing the nailcarrying loop and again bent to form eyes, through which a second rod passes, the free ends of the wire being bent at right angles and having hooks at their ends which are adapted to be interlocked after the ends are passed about the handle of the hammer. By this provision it Will be noted that the nailholding device may be held tightly against the head of a hammer, and by means of the spring-arms formed by the ends of the wire the nail-holding attachment is held snugly against the side or face of the hammer.\nTo these ends and to such others as the invention may pertain, the same consists, further, in the novel construction, arrangement, and adaptation of parts, as will be hereinafter more fully described, and then specifically defined in the appended claims.\nMy invention is clearly illustrated in the accompanying drawings, which, with the letters of reference marked thereon, form part of this application, and in which drawings similar letters of reference indicate like parts throughout both views, in which-- Figure 1 is a side elevation of a hammer, showing my improved nail-holding device se cured to thehandle and side of the hammerhead; and Fig. 2 is an enlarged detail View of the device removed from the hammer and handle.\nReference now being bad to the details of the drawings by letter, A designates the piece of wire, which is bent upon itself at A, with a slight space intervening, as at B. Said wire is bent to form a coil at B, and the two rightangled wing portions 0 are formed out of the wire, after which the eyes D are formed by coiling the wire. Thence right-angled pro jectingportions E of the wire are bent and a second series of eyes F formed, and the ends of the wires are thence bent substantially at right angles to the portions of the wire be tween the said sets of eyes and at their extreme ends are provided with hooks H. Mounted in each set of eyes D and F are the rods K, which when the device is placed upon the handle of a hammer are disposed on opposite sides thereof, as shown clearly in Fig. 1 of the drawings. A\nThe application and operation of my device are as follows, viz: The Wire nail-holding device is slipped over the end of the handle of the hammer, the handle passing between the two rods K, and after the device has been pushed up to the head of the hammer, so that the looped or nailengaging portion rests against the side of the hammer-head, the spring-arms, having hooks Hat their ends, are bent over the hammer-handle and the ends interlocked on the side of the handle on which the nail holding portion is disposed. By bringing these arms about the handle and in terlocking the same the tension caused/by bending said ends will cause the nail carrying portion to snugly bind,agaihst the hammer and hold the same firmly in place.\nHaving thusdescribed my invention, what I claim to be new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is",

HOAGLAND, OF PERU, ILLINOIS.\nWHEEL.\nSPECIFICATION forming part of Letters I atent No. 640,198, dated January 2, 1900.\nApplication filed October 14, 1899. Serial No. 733,582. (No model.)\nTo all whom, it may concern.-\nBeitknown that I,WILLIAM K. HOAGLAND, a citizen of the United States,residin g at Peru, in the county of La Salle and State of Illinois, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in \\Vheels, of which the following is a specification, reference being had to the accompanying drawings.\nMy invention relates to improvements in wheels, and particularly to wheels which are formed wholly of metal. Heretofore it has been usual in wheels of this class to connect the spokes with the hub in such a way that it is difficult to remove them, and in case a spoke becomes broken the wheel is rendered useless.\nIt is one of the objects of my invention to make a metal wheel in which the spokes may be so secured to the hub that in case one of them is broken it may be readily detached and a new spoke put in its place.\nAnother object of my invention is to provide a new and improved hub particularly adapted for use in metal wheels, to which the spokes maybe firmly secured, but at the same time so secured that they may be easily detached therefrom.\nAnother object of my invention is to provide a new and improved device for clampin g the ends of spokes to the hub of a wheel so that they may be easily detached therefrom in case they become broken.\nI attain these objects as hereinafter specified and as illustrated in the drawings.\nThat which I regard as new will be set forth in the claims.\nIn the drawings, Figure 1 is a side view of a hub with portions of several spokes attached, the spokes being broken away a short distance from the hub. Fig. 2 is a detail, being a section on line 2 2 of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a detail, being a view of the clamp by which the spokes are secured to the hub; and Fig. 4 shows a modification, being a side view of the hub of a wheel with several spokes attached and broken away a short distance from the hub.\nReferring to the drawings, 0 indicates a central boss, which is provided with an opening 6, adapted to receive the end of an axle.\n7 indicates a circumferential circular plate,\nwhich is preferably formed integral with the boss 5.\n8 indicates grooves formed in the plate 7, extending from the circumference toward the center of the hub and of such shape as to form one half of a socket to receive the end of a spoke, the other half being formed by the clamping device hereinafter described.\n9 indicates openings in the hub placed one upon one side of each of the grooves 8 and adapted to receive a lug on the clamp hereinafter described.\n10 indicates openings in the plate 7,adapted to receive a bolt hereinafter described.\n11 indicates the clamp, which is formed with a recess 12, which corresponds in shape with the grooves 8 and is adapted when the clamp 11 is placed in position to register with the groove 8, so as to form a socket for the end of thespoke.\n13 indicates a lug formed upon the clamp 11 and having at its end a bent portion 14, which forms a shoulder adapted to engage with the surface of the plate 7 opposite to the surface upon which the clamps are placed. The lug 13 is adapted to enter the opening 9, whereby the clamp is pivotally engaged at one end with the plate or flange 7. 15indicates a shoulder formed upon the other side of the clamp from the lug 13, which is provided with an opening 16, adapted to receive a. bolt 17.\n18 indicates spokes, the ends of which are adapted to fit the sockets formed by the clamps 11 and the grooves Sin theplate when the clamps 11 are placed in position.\nIn putting the wheel together the lug 13 is inserted through the opening 9, the'end of the spoke 1S placed in the socket, which is formed by the registering of the recess in the clamp 11 with the groove 8, and the clamp 11 is tightly clamped upon the spoke by means of the bolt 17.\nIt will be obvious that the clamp 11 constitutes a species of lever which at one end pivotally engages the flange or plate 7 and by means of the bolt 17 is drawn down upon the spoke when in position, so as to tightly bind the spoke in the socket and firmly secure it to the hub.\nIn the modification shown in Fig. 4 Ihave shown a form of hubin which a greater number of spokes may be used. In this form the circular plate 7 is made larger and with a greater number of grooves. The grooves 8 extend from the periphery of the plate 7 to the central boss, and between them are grooves 8 which extend only aportion of the distance from the periphery of the plate 7 toward the boss 5, thus affording room for the clamping upon the hub of a greater number of spokes. The clamping devices are the same as above described.\nThat which I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-",
    "claims": "That which I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-\n1. A hub provided with a circumferential flange having grooves forming each one half of a spoke-socket and with clamping-levers adapted at one end to pivotally engage said flange at one side of said groove, and having each a recess forming the other half of a spoke-socket, and with means for forcing the other end of said clamping-levers down toward and securing the same to said hub, suband a hub having grooves forming each one half of a spoke-socket, of clamping-levers adapted at one end to pivotally engage said hub and having each a recess adapted to coact with one of said grooves and form the other half of a spoke-socket, and means for forcing the other end of said clamping-levers toward and securing the same to said hub, substantially as described.\n4:. In a wheel, the combination with spokes, and a hub provided with a circumferential flange having grooves forming each one half of a spoke-socket, of clamping-levers adapted at one end to pivotally engage said hub and having each a recess adapted to coact with one of said grooves and form the other half of a spoke-socket, and means for forcing the other end of said clamping-levers toward and securing the same to said hub, substantially as described.\n5. In a wheel, the combination with spokes, of a hub having a circular plate provided with grooves and openings beside said grooves, clamps provided each with. a recess adapted to register with said grooves and form a spoke-socket, and with a lug at one end adapted to enter said openings and engage said plate, and devices for securing the other end of said clamp to said plate, substantially as described.\nWILLIAM K.
