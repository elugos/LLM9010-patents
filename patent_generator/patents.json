The two new strains produce a novel exopolysaccharide (EPS) and have several desirable characteristics that are absent from the parent strain, including improved culture properties, since they do not produce an EPS capsule layer like that of the parent 115 strain. The 115SL EPS is instead excreted as a slime layer which is not confined to the immediate area surrounding the cells. Since cells are not trapped within a floc where they grow at a reduced rate or die because of nutrient starvation, the new strains have more consistent and reproducible growth cycles and increased growth rates. As a consequence, exopolysaccharide production is more consistent and titers are higher. The separation of the EPS from the cells is also much easier and more economical. The other very important characteristic of strains 115SL and 115SLR is that they are able to receive foreign DNA using conventional techniques due to the absence of the capsule layer. This facilitates the application of recombinant DNA technology to control and produce novel expolysaccharides.",

    "description": "A method and device for controlling a power supply for arc welding in a manner to reduce spatter when the power supply is employed for depositing metal from a welding wire or electrode onto a workpiece by the short circuiting transfer mode wherein a welding current causes the welding wire to alternate between a short circuit condition and an arc condition with metal transfer occurring during a short circuit condition. This method and device includes the concept of shifting the welding current to a background current value in response to a short circuit condition, holding the welding current generally at the background current level for a preselected time, then allowing the welding current to reach the normal unimpeded current level, and causing the holding step to be terminated before the selected time in response to a detected arc condition. This concept provides a predetermined low current condition immediately upon establishing a short circuit between the welding wire or electrode and the workpiece, which low current condition is retained long enough to convert what otherwise would be a spatter-laden momentary short circuit to a short circuit where metal is transferred to the workpiece. Further, the method and device detects the slope of the welding current or voltage and shifts the welding current to the low background current level when the welding current reaches its maximum value just before breakage of the metal from the wire thus reducing the spatter energy when the molten metal breaks from the wire.",

By providing an antireflex layer, this problem is suppressed, but other disadvantages are obtained, such as a large line width. However, by providing a phase layer on the antireflection coating, the operation of the laser in a single mode is combined with a comparatively narrow line width. Furthermore, a reflective coating can be applied to the phase layer. In this case, both the module and the phase of the effective reflection can be adjusted substantially independently of each other, as a result of which a narrow line width and SLM can be more readily combined. \n     The antireflex coating, the phase layer and the reflective coating can be manufactured by means of not more than two materials having a suitable refractive index.

Further, there is a definite ratio of height to effective internal diameter (H:ID) of each of the gas passages. These catalysts are especially effective for endothermal reactions because both the internal and external surfaces of the support are coated with catalysts and are more efficiently heated. This is especially true for the internal surfaces of the support (i.e., the walls of the axially oriented gas passages) which heretofore have been shielded from the infra-red rays radiating from the tubes of the catalytic reactor. Thus, heat transfer to the catalyst surface is more effective in maintaining the interior surface at the desired elevated reaction temperature.

    "description": "A vehicle body compartment is closed by a closure panel movable between an open positiion and a closed position. A latch assembly mounted on the panel has a latch bolt spring biased to an unlatched position and normally maintained in the latched position by a detent lever. A pull down mechanism includes a housing mounted on a vehicle body and a striker mounted thereon by a motorized vertically reciprocating drive unit for moving the striker between extended position and a retracted position. When the panel is moved toward the closed position, the latch bolt engages with the extended striker to interconnect the panel with the striker. The drive unit is energized and retracts the striker, thereby pulling the panel to its fully closed position. To open the panel, the operator energizes the drive unit to move the striker from the retracted position to the extended position. A plunger is mounted on the latch assembly and engages with the vehicle body so that progressive opening movement of the panel by the extension of the striker permits a spring to extend the plunger. A cam device acts between the plunger and the detent lever of the latch assembly to cam the detent lever to the position releasing the latch bolt, thereby disconnecting the panel from the striker and freeing the panel for movement to the open position.",

The keyboard mechanism also includes a shift register having one more bit position than the number of switch devices and into which a bit is introduced into the &#34;one&#34; position at the instant the scan encounters a closed switch of the keyboard. This bit is then shifted through the register in timed relation to the scan of the remaining key switches and unloaded into the last bit position of the register. A detector senses the presence of a bit in both the &#34;one&#34; position and the last position of the shift register and upon detection of a bit solely in the one position it delivers a signal indicative of the character represented by the actuated key and upon detecting bits in the two extreme positions of the shift register it nullifies the delivery of such a signal.",
    "summary": "High speed serial scan and readout of keyboards is claimed to be the most accurate way to measure electrical signals from a keyboard. Claim 1: In a keyboard operated machine including a plurality of actuatable keys each being operable from a normal inactive position to an actuated position. Claim 2: A shift register of N+1 stages wherein N is the number of keys in the keyboard."

    "title": "Automatic target detection and recognition",
    "description": "A segment labeler/extractor outputs segments of video data stored in Random Access Memory for feature extraction and classification as targets. This function is accomplished by labeling the segments of a video frame as the segments are stored in a mass segment memory, sorting the mass segment memory to extract individual segment data, and storing this data in a segment memory where it can be accessed by an algorithm processor. Included in the subject invention is a segment labeler which consists of a segment label filter, adjacent label filter, memory, and sorter. The inputs to the segment labeler are a segment designator discrete which is set for only pixels which are in segments and a segment boundary designation discrete which is set for only pixels which are in segments and on the perimeter of the segment. The output of the segment labeler is a unique group of labels which define each segment. The groups of labels are then passed on to a control processor and handed to a segment extractor upon request. The segment extractor which consists of memory stores the segment intensity, position, status and label for all pixels in time sequence for a frame of data. Segments are then extracted individually by matching all pixels which belong to the unique group of labels. Individual segments are then presented for post processing, eliminating processing of any unnecessary data.",
