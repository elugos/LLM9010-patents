    "description": "Two new bacterial strains designated Zoogloea ramigera 115SL and Zoogloea ramigera 115SLR, a rifampicin resistant derivative of 115SL, have been developed. These strains are derived from the wild type Zoogloea ramigera 115, ATCC 25935. The two new strains produce a novel exopolysaccharide (EPS) and have several desirable characteristics that are absent from the parent strain, including improved culture properties, since they do not produce an EPS capsule layer like that of the parent 115 strain. The 115SL EPS is instead excreted as a slime layer which is not confined to the immediate area surrounding the cells. Since cells are not trapped within a floc where they grow at a reduced rate or die because of nutrient starvation, the new strains have more consistent and reproducible growth cycles and increased growth rates. As a consequence, exopolysaccharide production is more consistent and titers are higher. The separation of the EPS from the cells is also much easier and more economical. The other very important characteristic of strains 115SL and 115SLR is that they are able to receive foreign DNA using conventional techniques due to the absence of the capsule layer. This facilitates the application of recombinant DNA technology to control and produce novel expolysaccharides.",

    "title": "Apparatus for manual operation of vehicle brake and accelerator pedals",
    "description": "A device for manually operating the brake and accelerator pedals of a vehicle. The device is removably clamped to each of the conventional brake and accelerator pedals of a vehicle and includes a control lever that extends between respective pivot points that are fixed relative to and spaced outwardly from each of the brake and accelerator pedals. The control lever includes an outwardly extending portion that extends beyond the brake pedal in a direction opposite from the accelerator pedal, and a control handle is pivotally connected at the outer end of the lever extension. The control handle is operable by the user, and when pulled in a direction toward the user the device causes the braking actuator to move in a brake releasing direction while simultaneously causing the accelerator to open the throttle and thereby permit the vehicle to move. Pushing downwardly on the control handle in a direction toward the brake pedal will cause the device to push the brake pedal downwardly and thereby actuate the braking system, while simultaneously retracting the accelerator pedal to close the throttle and thereby assist in slowing the vehicle. The brake and accelerator pedals are controlled in such a way that operation of the device activates one pedal and precludes activation of the other pedal. Also, when no pressure is applied to the handle in either direction both the brake and accelerator pedals are in their off position. The device is simple to construct, and is thereby inexpensive, and it also adjustable and can be readily and quickly attached to or removed from a vehicle without requiring modifications thereto.",

    "title": "Coating for DFB/DBR laser diodes",
    "description": "In DFB/DBR semiconductor diode lasers, competition may arise between the DFB (Distributed Feed-Back) mode corresponding to the period of the grid present and the FP (=Fabry-Perot) mode determined by the relative distance of the mirror surfaces, as a result of which the laser does not operate in one single mode. By providing an antireflex layer, this problem is suppressed, but other disadvantages are obtained, such as a large line width. However, by providing a phase layer on the antireflection coating, the operation of the laser in a single mode is combined with a comparatively narrow line width. Furthermore, a reflective coating can be applied to the phase layer. In this case, both the module and the phase of the effective reflection can be adjusted substantially independently of each other, as a result of which a narrow line width and SLM can be more readily combined. \n     The antireflex coating, the phase layer and the reflective coating can be manufactured by means of not more than two materials having a suitable refractive index. Two particularly suitable materials are hafnium oxide and silicon dioxide, which can be applied to the mirror surfaces by means of the comparatively simple and attractive vapor deposition technique.",

    "description": "A layer of titanium carbosilicide Ti3SiC2 on a silicon carbide surface polished for making a joint makes it possible to join silicon carbide bodies together in a hot pressing procedure and obtaining a joint strength comparable to the strength of the silicon carbide material. Such a layer on silicon carbide also makes possible brazed juoints with steel alloy or nickel based alloy parts. The layer may be applied directly by a powder dispersion in a volatile but viscous glycol or by sputtering or else the layer can be made in place from a powder mixture of components, especially TiC0,8 and Tisi2 (5:1) or a titanium layer of a thickness in the range of 1 to 3  mu m that reacts with the silicon carbide surface. When silicon carbide parts are joined together, the heating up to make the joint also serves to convert a titanium layer into titanium carbosilicide. When silicon carbide is to be joined with metal, a preliminary heating step is necessary to at first convert a powder mixture or a titanium layer on the silicon carbide surface to Ti3SiC2. Alternatively a Ti3SiC 2 surface layer can be formed by a sputtering process. The Ti3SiC2 layer favors brazing of the metal part to the silicon carbide surface as treated. The heating requires reaching a temperature in the region from 1200 DEG  to 1600 DEG  C. for periods between a half hour to about three hours in the presence of a reducing protective gas.",

One or more birefringent elements (11) receive a polarized optical signal from a local oscillator (12), and vary the state of polarization of the local optical signal in order to match it to a received optical signal from a remote source on a line (13). The transformed local signal is fed on a line (14) to a directional coupler (15) which compares the local and remote optical signals. A receiver (16) extracts data by interference between the two signals in the directional coupler (15), and feeds data out at a line (17).

    "description": "A vehicle body compartment is closed by a closure panel movable between an open positiion and a closed position. A latch assembly mounted on the panel has a latch bolt spring biased to an unlatched position and normally maintained in the latched position by a detent lever. A pull down mechanism includes a housing mounted on a vehicle body and a striker mounted thereon by a motorized vertically reciprocating drive unit for moving the striker between extended position and a retracted position. When the panel is moved toward the closed position, the latch bolt engages with the extended striker to interconnect the panel with the striker. The drive unit is energized and retracts the striker, thereby pulling the panel to its fully closed position. To open the panel, the operator energizes the drive unit to move the striker from the retracted position to the extended position. A plunger is mounted on the latch assembly and engages with the vehicle body so that progressive opening movement of the panel by the extension of the striker permits a spring to extend the plunger.

The encoding technique converts a one-in-(2 n  -1) digital code into an n-bit binary word that is the same as quasi-Gray code in all but its least significant bit position, which alternates in the same manner as standard binary code. For many multiple simultaneous inputs, the modified quasi-Gray code substantially reduces errors when compared with quasi-Gray code. For example, the modified quasi-Gray code reduces the maximum error from 3 to 2 for two simultaneous inputs separated by two bit positions (n=8). In a typical parallel analog-to-digital converter employing the modified quasi-Gray code, the one-in-(2 n  -1) digital code is converted into modified quasi-Gray code using a read-only memory.
