    "description": "A motor vehicle power line comprises a combustion engine (8), a gearbox (10) and an electronically controlled clutch (20). The engine throttle (84) is actuated by an electric motor (92) controlled by the electronic control (48) usually in response to throttle demand signals. A manual move of the gear shift level (16) causes the clutch (20) automatically to disengage. When a new gear is engaged the clutch (20) is automatically re-engaged. When the gear change is an up-change the clutch (20) is automatically disengaged to lower (102) its torque transmitting capacity (C) from a maximum (C1) to zero. As the gear change progresses the new gear starts to be engaged causing the speed (B) of the gearbox input shaft (14) and clutch driven plate (32) to drop (110) to (Sn). While this is happening control (48) takes full control of the throttle and closes it. The disengaged clutch and closed throttle causes the engine speed (A) to decelerate (114). When the new gear is fully engaged at time (t4), the control (48) causes the clutch to re-engage at a first relatively quck rate (118) from zero up to a pre-determined target torque transmitting capacity (Ct) and then at a lower rate (124).",

The convertible feature is particularly advantageous since an emergency locking retractor does not provide the desired firm positioning of child restraint systems. The emergency locking retractor, however, has advantages in terms of occupant comfort and convenience since they permit free movement of the occupants within the vehicle. In accordance with this invention, the retractor is converted to the automatic locking mode by first fully withdrawing the seat belt webbing therefrom. Such action causes a switching lever to force a leaf spring in a position against the retractor locking bar.
