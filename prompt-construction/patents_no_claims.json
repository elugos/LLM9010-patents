    "title": "Power line to drive a vehicle",
    "description": "A motor vehicle power line comprises a combustion engine (8), a gearbox (10) and an electronically controlled clutch (20). The engine throttle (84) is actuated by an electric motor (92) controlled by the electronic control (48) usually in response to throttle demand signals. A manual move of the gear shift level (16) causes the clutch (20) automatically to disengage. When a new gear is engaged the clutch (20) is automatically re-engaged. When the gear change is an up-change the clutch (20) is automatically disengaged to lower (102) its torque transmitting capacity (C) from a maximum (C1) to zero. As the gear change progresses the new gear starts to be engaged causing the speed (B) of the gearbox input shaft (14) and clutch driven plate (32) to drop (110) to (Sn). While this is happening control (48) takes full control of the throttle and closes it. The disengaged clutch and closed throttle causes the engine speed (A) to decelerate (114). When the new gear is fully engaged at time (t4), the control (48) causes the clutch to re-engage at a first relatively quck rate (118) from zero up to a pre-determined target torque transmitting capacity (Ct) and then at a lower rate (124).",

The convertible feature is particularly advantageous since an emergency locking retractor does not provide the desired firm positioning of child restraint systems. The emergency locking retractor, however, has advantages in terms of occupant comfort and convenience since they permit free movement of the occupants within the vehicle.

Such action causes a switching lever to force a leaf spring in a position against the retractor locking bar. When, however, a predetermined amount of seat belt webbing is returned upon the retractor spool, the leaf spring returns to its normal position, thereby restoring emergency locking operation to the retractor.",

The elongated catheter or other device passes through the opening of the annular transducer. Based on the shape of such transducers and the wavelength used, the response of the transducers is a function of the angle of the insonifying beam to the catheter axis. The particular response of such transducers is shown to depend on the curvature of the annular marker, with the radius of curvature chosen on the basis of the wavelength used in the ultrasonic scanning system; between 2-50 wavelengths.",
