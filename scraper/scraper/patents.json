TAYLOR.\nGOLF BALL.\nAPPLI CATION'IILED SEPT.11.1906.\n\\ walls confined to the immediate neighbon UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE.\nGOLF-BALL.\nNo. events.\nSpecification of Letters B atant.\nPatented Feb. 4, 1908.\nApplication filed September 11,1906. Serial No. 334.123.\nTo all whom it may concern:\nBe. it known that 1, WILLIAM TAYLOR, a subject of the King ofGreat Britain, residing at 57 Sparkenhoe street, Ize'icester, in the county of Leicester, England, engineer, have invented certain new and useful Irn rovements in Golf-Balls, of whichthe fol owing is a specification.\nThis invention relates to balls such as are used in the game of golf and hasfor its principal object to obtain better results in the flight of the ball in the direction of a sustained hanging flight giving a fiat trajectory with a'slight rising tendency particularly towards the end of the flight, than havebeen possible with balls of known types. Formerly the most common marking for such balls consisted of numerous grooves of even width intersectin each other and leaving between them iso ated polygonal portions of the spherical surface of the ball, and it has been proposed to invert this marking so that the spherical surface-of the ball consists of numerous ridges intersecting each other and inclosing isolated polygonal cavities. Another common marking consists in forming the surface with numerous separate prominenccs resembling those upon the sur face of a blackberry and named on this account the bramble pattern. The character of the marking which constitutes the present invention may be described in general terms as an inverted bramble pattern, and consists ofisolated cavities the essential features of which are. that they must be substantially circular in plan and substan tially evenly distributed, they must be shallow, and their sides, particularly at the lip of the cavity, must he steep. Stcepness of the cavity walls is essential to the hanging flight, but excessive depth besides )romoting the collection of dirt, is detrimental to length of flight by offering great resistance to the passage of the air. Consequently the cavity must be shallow and the steepness of its hood of the lip. These features are described and illustrated in'the accompanying drawings, in which Figure l is an elevation and Fig. 2 a central section of a solid ball the surface of which is marked in the im rovcd manner,\n' it being understood that tie invention is equally applicable to the cored type of ball.\nFigs. 3, 4 and 5 are enlar ed detail views illustrating various forms 0 cavities.\nThe section of the cell which is exemplified may be of the form of a sha low inverted truncated cone (Fi 3) with flat bottom, the angle inclosed %)y the walls being less than a right angle, but preferabl the bot tom is made somewhat concave ig. 5) the rentrant angle is rounded as shown at 0 (Figs. 4 and 5) and the angle between the walls at the lip of the cell made more acute so that the section of the cavity becomes prae tically semi-elliptical (Fig. 5).\nPreferably the cavities should occup'y not less than a quarter nor more than three uarters of the entire surface of the ball, an the hundredths of an inch, nor should they be of greater depth than fourteen thousandths of an inch, and in any case their depth should not exceed one-ei hth of their diameter.\nThe whole of the surface of the ball be.- twccn the cavities may be left spherical, olthe surface immediatel surrounding the cavities may be sloped inwardly to the lip which may either be left sharp as in Fig. 4 or may be rounded o[l,as in Fig. 5, and by this means frictional resistance to passage through the air is lessened without sacrificing anything of the hanging cllect of the llight.\nWhen the improved marking is applied to cored balls, the shell has; thercb given to it an added tensile strength and elasticity due to the reticular structure of its surface which tends to prevent bursting and permanent set or slacking of the shell. Further, cavities of the character described with their recntrant angles rounded oil, do not readily collect dirt, and are easily-cleaned.\nHaving thus described the nature of this invention and the best means I know of carrying the same into ractical effect, Iclaim:' l l.

Serial No. 153,246.\n, To all whom it may concern:\nMy invention relates to sectional doorswhich are elevated in opening and transfer a portion of the weight to an auxiliary support. Furthermore, it has special reference to large, heavy doors which are adapted for warehouses, pier sheds and the like.\nOne object of my invention is to equip a sectional door of the aforesaid character with a movable member, such as, for example, an\narm or lever which is adapted to be retracted when the door is closed and automatically moved into position to engage a bracket or other suitable auxiliary support when the door is in its open position.\nAnother object is to provide a folding door having a movable arm or other member which is adapted to be moved in response to the relative movement or folding action of the door sections into a position to engage a stationary bracket or other auxiliary support when the door is opened.\nIn order that my invention may be thoroughly understood 1 will now proceed to describe the same in the following specification, and then point out the novel features thereof in appended claims.\nReferring to the drawings:\nFigure 1 is a sectional elevation of a door equipped with one embodiment of my invention.\nFig. 2 is a view corresponding to Fig. 1, but showing the door in its open instead of in its closed position.\nFig. 3 illustrates a modified door structure which also embodies my invention. This is also a sectional elevation and corresponds to Fig. 2 except that the door is not com pletely opened.\nIn the drawings, designates a post and 11 the lintel of a door frame. The door comprises an upper section 12 hinge-connected above the lintel at 13, an intermediate section 14 connected by hinges 15 to the section 12and a sliding bottom section 16. My invention is equally applicable to two section doors and in fact is applicable to doors of various types.\nIn the arrangement shown the intermediate section 14 has guideways 17 in which the bottom section runs and the bottom section has rollers 18 or other projections which engage the door posts and may cooperate with guides (not shown) thereon in a well known manner.\nSecured to the upper door section 12 is a bracket 20 on which a bell crank lever having arms 21 and 22 is pivotally mounted. The arm 21 of the bell crank lever has an extension 23 with which one end of a'spring 24 is connected. The other arm 22 has a roller or wheel 25 which is adapted to engage a suitable auxiliary support, such as the stationary bracket 26, which is suspended from ceiling beams 27 and may form part of the ceiling'st ructure. The hoisting mechanism for the door may be of the usual type and is designated 28.\nA link 29 is pivotally connected at 30 to the intermediate door sectionld and is provided with a slot 31 near its opposite end which provides a lost motion connection between the link and the arm 21 of the bell crank lever. The other end of spring 24 is connected with this link 29 at 32. The arrangement of parts is such that when the door is shut, as shown in Fig. 1, the arm 21 is substantiall parallel to the plane of the door section 12, and when'the-door is opened the bell crank lever will be swung into the position illustrated'in Fig. 2, as soon as it is in position for its roller 25 to ride on top of the support 26 with the arm21sub'stantially perpendicular to the plane of the door section 12. e\nIn other words, the bell crank lever is swung by the link 29 relative to the door section when the doorsection is completely opened so that the roller arm is substantially parallel to the plane of the door section 12 and extends outwardly beyond the door section into engagement with the stationary support 25. t The lost motion provided by the slot 31 allows for an increase of the distance between the pivotal connection 30 and the pin on bell crank lever arm 21 during a part of the folding movement of the door sections,\nyam\nwithout pulling the arm 21 back, as the backward movement of the arm may be limited.\nlhe door shown in Fig. 3 in which corresponding parts are designated by the same reference characters, is pro vided with a bell crank lever 53 pivoted at as on the upper door section 12 (and connected to an arm which is mounted to slide in a bracket 36 near the bottom edge of the upper door section 12, 1\nA roller 3? is mounted on the arm 85 near ts outer end which extends beyond the fracliet 36 and sf 38 is arrangel to rot act the es and hold the roller 3? clo to the bracket 38 except when the door is fully opened,\nThe complete closing of the section Acupon the section 122 actuates the downwardly extending arm 39 of the bell cranlr lever 33 and forces the arm outward in opposition to the spring 38.

JONES, of the city of Philadelphia, in the State of Pennsylvania, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Caps for Bottles, Jars, &c., of which the following is 'a specification, reference being had to the accompanying drawings.\nO'ur invention relates to closures for vessels designed to be used but once and is adapted to indicate by its condition whether the vessel upon which it is secured has been opened or not.\nGenerally stated, our invention comprises a cap, preferably of sheet metal, provided with resilient sheet-metal tongues, the latter being adapted to automatically engage beneath a flange or lip upon the vessel to which the cap is applied in such manner as not to be detachable therefrom except by mutilation of the latter.\nIn the accompanying drawings,'Figure 1 is a sectional view showing a convenient embodiment of our invention applied upon a bottle. Fig. 2 is a sectional view showing a modified form of our invention applied upon a jar. Fig. 3 is a side elevation of the form of our invention shown in Fig. 1'. Fig. 4 is a fragmentary sectional view of theform of our invention shown in Fig. 2.\nReferring to Fig. 1, A is the bottle, the neck A of which is provided with a lateral flange or lip A and B is the cork inserted in said neck. The cap 0, which is adapted to in close said cork and neck, is provided with resilient sheet-metal tongues 0, adapted to automatically engage beneath the flange or lip A when the cap is placed in position, as indicated in Fig. 1.\nThe neck A is preferably provided with a shoulder a, projecting beneath the cap 0 and preferably of a diameter equal thereto, the shoulder a projecting beneath the cap 0 for engagement with the lower edge thereof and said tongues 0 being seated in the recess A In the form of our invention shown in Fig. 2 the jar A is provided with a rigid cork or sto er B which ma be maintained in air- PD a tight relation with the former by means of the intermediate packing-ring b preferably of soft rubber. In the latter form the resilient tongues o of the cap O engage beneath the flange a in the manner above set forth. It is obvious that it is necessary to destroy the cap O in order to remove the stopper B As shown in the several figures, the metal tongues which serve to secure the cap in position upon the vessel-neck are in integral relation with the cap-body and may be conveniently formed as illustrated in Fig. 4, being struck up from the dotted position to the position shown in full lines therein. 7\nWe are aware that it is not broadly new to form avessel-closure of sheet metal.

Schlueter and John R. Guenther, Milwaukee, Wis., assignors to Continental Can Company, Inc., New York, N.Y., a corporation of New York Filed Oct. 8, 195'6, Ser. No. 614,47 9\n3 Claims. (Cl. 35-66) The present invention relates to a new and improved type of chalkboard formed from bibulous sheet material impregnated with a solid organic plastic. More particularly, the present invention is directed to the provision of an improved organic plastic chalkboard and process of forming the same, the chalkboard being made from polyester resins of a type to be described and provided with a polyester overlay surface portion which is internally reinforced by the inclusion therein of dispersed finely ground material.\nChalkboards are nowand have been primarily manufactured from slate, painted hardboard surfaces, opaque glass, and porcelain enameled metal.` Each of these basic types of chalkboards is objectionable in at least one respect either in connection with the manufacturing of the same or subsequent installation and use. Slate, for example, being limited to the well known black color, is somewhat limited in use due to its availability in only moderately sized sheets and, further, due to the difficulties encountered in installing the slate because of its relative fragility. Still further, slate, as in the case of all natural products, is quite variable in quality and this among other characteristics places slate in the category of expensive material. A\nPainted hardboard surfaces are readily prepared in any color and the manufacturing of the same is relatively simplied by use of a paint spraying process. Painted hardboard surfaces are inexpensive and readily available on the present market and, consequently, are widely used. While a good initial surface appearance can be obtained with this type of chalkboard, the surface is comparatively soft, as is common with many different types of painted surfaces, and consequently the painted hardboard surface has very limited resistance to Still further, various types of hardboard adapted for painting to provide a chank-retaining and eraseable surface are generally avaliable in sizes which are limited which restricts the usefulness of` this type of chalkboard.\nOpaque glass with one frosted face can also be made available in almost any color and is wear-resistant to a desirable extent. However, glass chalkboards of this type are limited in size, extremely expensive, fragile, and diliicult to install. Porcelain enameled steel with a matte surface exhibits substantially all of the Ydesirable characteristics of opaque glass while eliminating the undesirable characteristic of fragility. However, porcelain` enameling is an expensive process and has limited resistance to the action of corrosive chemicals.\nWith the advent and widespread use of organic plastics in `many different fields, efforts have been made to provide chalkboards molded or cast from thermoplastic resins lsuch -as polymethyl methacrylate for the purpose of improving on the physical and chemical properties of commercial forms of chalkboards. However, in the case of molded or cast thermoplastic resins ithas been found that themanufacture of chalkboards is overly exanstatt Fatented Oct. 1l, 1960 pensive and these boards are limited as to size and are further unsatisfactory in connection with resistance to this cure.\nwear and solvents. High pressure laminates have been tested in connection with their suitability for use as chalkboards but the principal problem confronting these latter efforts resides in the provision of a uniform, satisfactory writing surface. Still further, chalkboards manufactured in this manner are limited in sheet size due to press limitations.\nWith continued investigations made in the organic plastic resin field, continuous processes such as those disclosed in United States Patent No. 2,496,911 and United States Patent No. 2,528,152 have been found capable of producing organic plastic laminates which are unlimited in size. In continuously forming this type of laminate, polyester resins (hereinafter specified generally as polymerized polyhydric alcohol esters of unsaturated dibasic acids) have been utilized in the impregnating of the fibrous sheet material which is subsequently laminated in a continuous manner, the polyester resin being polymerized to a rigid or flexible thermoset structure without the evolution of any volatile by-product whatsoever. The outstanding characteristic of the polyester resins resides in the non-volatile polymerization step which makes continuous production of laminates possible. Without the presence of a volatile by-produ'ct it is unnecessary to apply pressure during the curing cycle such as is necessary in curing many other types of resins, as, for example, the phenolic, melamine and urea types. While it is `possible to manufacture continuous laminates or sheets from thermoplastic resins, such as the vinyls, polystyrene, methacrylates and cellulose acetate by extruding or coating with the molten polymer, these plastic materials are devoid of the surface hardness, wear resistance, dimensional stability, solvent and corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and permanency of the thermosetting resins such as the polyesters.\nA polyester resin for the purpose of the present invention is a complex product normally prepared by polymerizing the polyhydric alcohol esters of unsaturated dibasic acids. Typical polyhydric alcohols are ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerine, erythritol, pentaerythritol, butylene glycols, 'sorbitoL' and mannitol. Typical unsaturated dibasic acids are maleic, fumarie, and itaconic. The properties of these resins may be modified to obtain variations in ultimate properties by the use of substituted polyhydric alcohols and unsaturated dibasic acids (those in which one or more hydrogen atoms per molecule have been replaced with another element or an organic radical), and by the replacement of a portion of the unsaturated dibasic acids with saturated dibasic acids, such as phthalic, terephthalic, adipic, sebacic, and tetrachlorophthalic, or with chlorendic acid which, though unsaturated, behaves like a saturated compound with respect to polymerization. By these substitutions, resins which yield rigid, exible, lire-resistant or other properties may be obtained.\nResins of the type described may be either thermoplastic, as where the chain-like polymeric ester molecules are not connected to one another', or thermosetting, in the instance Where the chain-like polymeric polyester molecules are interconnected or crosslinked to one another. Commercial polyester resins are usually marketed in an incompletely polymerized form (liquid resin) by their manufacturers and users of these resins can then cure them by advancing the degree of polymerization in a laminating, casting or molding operation. As previously described, no volatile by-products result during Crosslinking the liquid polyester resin molecules by means of monomeric unsaturated molecules such as styrene, methyl styrene, vinyl acetate and methyl methacrylate impart good physical properties to the resin. Because of the generally better results obtained with styrene and the economic advantages inherent in its use, this crosslinking monomer is most commonly used. Consequently, the great majority of all commercially available liquid polyester resins are actually solutions of such resins in monomeric styrene.\nIn generally considering the continuous process of Patent No. 2,496,911, bibulous sheet material is impregnated with liquid organic plastic, such as a polyester resin, and any desired number of plies of the impregnated sheet material are brought together to form a laminate in a continuous manner. The sheet material used may include any natural or artificial material which exists in fibrous form to provide bibulous plastic reinforcement. Reinforcements of prime importance are natural kraft papers, bleached kraft papers, cotton linters and purified alpha cellulose papers. To be adapted for use in the continuous laminating process, the thicker core paper must preferably have better than average mechanical properties, be substantially uniform in caliper and composition, and have a pore structure that will allow for ready impregnation by the resin. The facing sheet may be pigmented or otherwise colored depending upon the desired color of the final product and such pigmentation is readily observable due to the transparency of the polyester resins. Once the desired laminate is formed, a nonbibulous sheet material is used to cover the exposed surfaces of the same so as to retain the shape of the laminated sheet during polymerization and, further, provide the exposed surfaces of the same with the type of finish desired. Polymerization is completed by the application of heat in any suitable manner such as disclosed in the above identified patent.\nIn using the continuous process it is possible to maintain a much closer tolerance in the over-all product as the material forming the product is passed through a set of combining rollers. Once a roll setting is made, the material is uniformly handled throughout any one continuous area. The resultant polyester laminate is readily adapted for many different uses. Such uses include insulation, building materials, luggage covering, advertising displays, etc. As the polyester resins contain no plasticizers, there is no volatile component to escape over a period of years, during the use of the laminate. Still further, due to the completion of polymerization and the presence of a thermoset state, subsequent change in the molecular structure does not take place and no change in physical properties are observable over an extended period of time. Polyester resin laminates are adapted to withstand elevated temperatures, are highly resistant to wear, and are resistant to a wide range of chemicals and food products.\nDue to the presence of the aforementioned desirable properties in polyester resin laminates, and, further, due to the adaptability of these laminates in being formed in a continuous manner thereby eliminating size restrictions, it has been found that by treating the polyester resin laminates in a manner to be described during the continuous formation thereof, a new and improved chalkboard can be continuously fabricated and formed. The chalkboard exhibits the necessary desirable physical and chemical characteristics of existing chalkboards while at the same time overcoming or not exhibiting the various undesirable features or limitations presently encountered in the manufacture and use of chalkboards.\nIt is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved organic plastic chalkboard formed from a polymerized polyester resin reinforced with fibrous sheet material, which chalkboard exhibits over-all composite properties of an improved and lasting nature.\nA further object is to provide a new and improved polyester resin chalkboard laminate having a resin over- 4 lay surface portion internally reinforced with nely ground material, the exposed face of the overlay surface portion being provided with a matte finish which is chalk-retaining while being readily eraseable.\nAnother object is to provide a chalkboard formed from polymerized polyester resin reinforced with bibulous material and being provided with a polymerized resin overlay surface portion exhibiting the desired chemical and physical properties of an appropriate chalk-retaining and eraseable surface, the reinforced polymerized resin chalkboard being adapted for manufacture in either rigid or flexible form and being further readily adapted for mounting on any desirable backing material.\nStill a further object is to provide a new and improved chalkboard formed from polymerized polyester resin laminate provided with a polymerized polyester resin overlay surface portion in which is dispersed finely ground glass and the writing face of which is provided with a flat, uniform, dull finish which is smooth to the touch and which diffuses refiected light uniformly to eliminate observable glare even at a low angle of refraction.\nAn additional object is to provide a process of forming a polyester resin chalkboard laminate which includes steps which can be continuously followed so as to provide uninterrupted operation in the forming of continuous sheets of chalkboard-forming material.\nOther objects not specifically set forth will become apparent from the following detailed description.\nIn the accompanying drawing,\nFigs. 1, 2 and 3 are enlarged diagrammatic sectional views of various forms of laminates of the types to be described.\nThe chalkboard of the present invention as previously described is formed from polymerized polyester resin which in its liquid state has been reinforced by one or more plies of bibulous sheet material and which further has been provided with an overlay surface portion of polyester resin throughout which has been dispersed finely ground reinforcing material. The writing face of the chalkboard, being the exposed surface of the overlay portion, provides a wear and abuse-resistant writing surface which is easily erased and which has minimum shine or glare, both as manufactured and after extended continuous use. This type of chalkboard is readily adapted for manufacture in a continuous manner as discussed above and as disclosed in the aforementioned patents. Consequently, any desired thickness of chalkboard may be produced and the chalkboard may be manufactured as either a rigid or resilient sheet in any desired color as will subsequently be described. Chalkboards of this type are readily backed up with relatively inexpensive material such as masonite, plywood, etc. to obtain the structural rigidity required in use. The chalkboard may be adhered to a backing in the factory and thus sold as mounted sheets or it may be applied to the backing at the site of installation so as to obtain the advantages of a continuous, joint-free writing surface.\nIn forming the chalkboard of the present invention any suitable process can be followed which will provide a reinforced polymerized polyester resin sheet provided with a polymerized polyester resin overlay having dispersed therein a quantity of finely ground reinforcing material such as glass. By referring to glass it is intended to cover an amorphous transparent or translucent brittle material usually made by fusion of silica, soda ash and salt cake or similar materials. Preferably, the continuous types of processes disclosed in the above identified patents are basically used so as to overcome restrictions as to sheet size while at the same time provide uniformity of product. One or more sheets of reinforcing or bulkproviding material, such as kraft paper, alpha cellulose paper or cotton linters, are impregnated with liquid polyester resin formulation. This formulation may be either a rigid type polyesters resin or a flexible type polyester resin depending upon the physical characteristics desired in the end product. The resin formulation will generally consist of a polyestervin styrene'solution and include a suitable polymerization catalyst such as a peroxide. The thickness of the end product Will depend primarily upon the number of plies of impregnated sheets used and impregnation of these sheets may be brought about in any suitable manner.\nAs an example of obtaining impregnation, each sheet may be continuously run through a body of liquid polyester resin formulation and subsequently joined together in face-to-face relation to form a laminate. Some of the sheets may be impregnated and joined with unimpregnated sheets, the excess polyester resin formulation functioning to impregnate the additional sheets combined thereby. This latter procedure is adapted for use where an extremely porous paper, such as cotton linters, is used as reinforcing paper. The impregnated reinforcing sheets are combined by the use of rollers and the thickness of the laminated plies are controlled by the setting of the rollers. Following the formation of the laminate, a surface of the same is passed through a portion of liquid polyester resin formulation which has dispersed throughout therein finely ground glass or anyother suitable reinforcing, abrasive material. Thus,` an o verlay surface portion which should not exceed 0L005 of an inch in thickness is applied to a surface of the uncured laminate, the thickness of the overlay portion being controlled by the passing of the treated laminate through a pair or pairs of rollers of a predetermined spaced setting.\nFig. l diagrammaticallyillustrates a laminate formed from a plurality of reinforcing plies 10, 11 and 12, the ply being a thin facing sheet of the type described in the examples below. The top surface of the laminate is provided with an overlay portion 13 having dispersed within the same finely ground particles of glass. Of course, in the illustration of Pig. l the thickness of the overlay 13 is exaggerated to better illustrate the formation of the chalkboard of the present invention.\nAt this stage of the process a non-bibulous covering material is used to cover both the top and bottom of the laminate so as to encase the'same during polymerization of the polyester'resin formulation. This arrangement is diagrammatically shown in Fig. 2 where sheets 14 and are used to cover the laminate. The non-bibulous encasing material in contactwith the exposed face of the overlay resin, such as the sheet 14 in Fig. 2, should be parchmentized paper capable of providing the overlay resin with a surface nish essentially identical to the writing surface finish desired on the chalkboard. The parchment used must have a uniform, matte surface, the degree of which is capable of providing a flat, uniform, dull surface on the overlay which feels smooth to the touch but diffuses reflected lightrso uniformly that no glare is apparent even at a low angle of refraction. The parchmentized'covering material ,is plasticized-las,` for example, with glycerine and water, and must separate or peel from the finished product following polymerization of the polyester resin formulation. This covering material m-ust also be essentially non-porous, be free of ropy areas, and have sufficient strength to carry the weight of the laminate through the ovens or other polymerization equipment. The parchmentized paper must obviously be easily wetted by the liquid resin in order to provide the degree of matte desired.\nFollowing encasing of the laminate, the entire assembly is carried o n tenter clamps through a series of progessively hotter ovens in the event that the process described in Patent No. 2,496,911 is followed. The cured laminate issuing from the terminal end of the oven is stripped of its encasing webs and either wound into rolls or sheared to desired sheet lengths. It may be passed through a sanding machine to roughen the back surface to make it more adaptable for cementing to a supporting surface with an adhesive which requires a roughened surface.\nIn the mounting of the laminate to a supporting base,\nany suitable type of adhesive may be used. Due to the uniformity of sheet manufacture and the provision of a completely fiat back surface, the laminated sheet may be readily applied to a substrate. Pressure is required only to maintain contact with the glue line and if the glue line has a pronounced initial grab, as in the case of contact adhesives, no special pressure is necessary. Following the gluing operation, any excess laminate sheet material overhanging the edges or cutouts of the substrate may be rapidly trimmed with a file. Arduous sawing often necessary in connection with the use of traditional chalkboard materials is thus entirely avoided. The laminate sheet when formed from flexible polyester resin formulations may be readily coiled thereby allowing self-edging and further adapting the laminate sheet for mounting on contoured surfaces. The polyester resin chalkboard may be adhered to plaster, wallboard, plywood, masonite, or any similar backing material either in wall-to-wall lengths or in segments, as desired.\nThe principal aspects of the chalkboard of the present invention reside in its adaptability for continuous manufacture and the presence of a unique surface which provides a wear and abuse-resistant writing surface that is easily erased and has minimum shine or glare, both as manufactured and after extended continuous use. `Such a surface is attained by the simultaneous use of a powdered-glass loaded overlay resin and a parchmentized paper of the correct texture. The presence of the dispersed powdered glass provides an improved wear resistance and resistance to gloss-up which is not found in known types of organic plastic chalkboards. Any suitable nely ground reinforcing material, such as glass, capable of providing the requisite physical properties may be used.\nThe following examples are illustrative of the organic plastic chalkboard and process of forming the same of the present invention and should not be construed as being limiting with respect thereto:\nExample l A continuous sheet of green pigmented alpha cellulose paper having a thickness of approximately 0.008 of an inch was continuously impregnated with a peroxide catalyzed rigid polyester resin formulation consisting of approximately 65% of a glycol phthalate maleate and approximately 35%, styrene. After a. period of approximately 24 hours at 70 F., the thoroughly impregnated paperwas placed on a continuous laminator and, after passing through one or more dip pans containing a similar resin formulation, was laminated with one or more plies of lkraft paper which had also been passed through the same resin formulation `for pre-impregnation thereby. The alpha cellulose paper formed the face sheet of the laminate which as illustrated in Fig. 1 is the ply 10. Immediately prior to the combining rolls effecting the lamination, an excess of the same polyester resin formulation filled with fine powdered glass of approximately 50 parts glass to parts resin was applied to the top surface of the green facing sheet. On passing through the combining rolls the overlay resin was evenly distributed at a uniform thickness of approximately 0.005 of an inch. Sirnultaneously, the entire laminate including the overlay portion was encased top and bottom in non-porous parchmentized paper of the type capable'of providing the face of the ovelay resin with a matte finish. The entire assembly was then carried on tenter clamps through a series of progressively hotter ovens in the manner described in Patent No. 2,496,911. Following polymerization the laminate was stripped of its covering material and was sheared to desired sheet lengths.\nExample 2 A facing sheet of solid black alpha cellulose paper having a thickness of approximately 0.004 of an inch was preimpregnated with a catalyzed resilient polyester resin 7 formation consisting approximately of 25% of a glycol phthalate maleate and 50% styrene modied by 25% of a glycol adipate maleate. The impregnated facing sheet was then laminated with a number of core sheets in the manner described in Example 1 with the exception that the powdered glass containing the overlay surface portion was formed from the same resilient resin formulation. Parchmentized paper was applied to the top portion of the laminate to thus provide the top encasingweb. The bottom encasing web was formed from glassine. Following polymerization as brought about in the same manner as described in Example 1, the parchmentized paper was stripped from the product and the glassine was removed by sanding.\nExample 3 Example 1 was repeated with the exception that the continuous process described in Patent No. 2,528,152 was followed. As described in this patent, a heated arcuate platen was used in completing polymerization of the polyester resin formulation. In using the heated platen the laminated sheet was run with the overlay portion and facing sheet in contact with the top surface of the platen, the encased laminate being slidably moved over the platen to provide the desired ironing action while being advanced by rollers which maintained uniform tension on the covering sheets to retain the same in rm sliding engagement with the arcuate platen.\nIn referring to the examples it will be noted that a pigmented facing sheet was used in forming the chalkboard. The polymerized polyester resins being transparent allow the use of pigmented facing sheets providing the chalkboard with any desired color. Thus the chalkboard formed in accordance with the principles of the present invention may be made in many different colors to further improve the appearance of the chalkboard as well as adapt the Same for varied uses. The glycol phthalate maleate is readily available commercially. Typical commercial resins are Selectron 5084 of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company and Paraplex P-43 of Rohm & Haas Company. This type of polyester resin is normally sold in a styrene solution of approximately 70% resin and 30% styrene. ditional styrene may be added as desired. The usual technique includes the addition of sufficient styrene to obtain a viscosity that works well with the particular reinforcements under impregnation. Such a viscosity falls generally within the range of about 200 to 1200 cps. The Viscosity of the overlay resin will preferably be higher, such as within the range of about 5,000 to 25,000 cps. With respect to the glycol adipate maleate, saturated dicarboxylic acids other than adipic may be used to attain a flexible resin, Paraplex P-13 of the Rohm & Haas Company is such a flexible polyester resin. In formulating the flexible polyester resin the amount of flexible resin added to the rigid resin will vary depending on the For optimum viscosity and rate of reaction adrelative liexibility desired. Generally, the amount of powdered glass used will fall within the range of about l5 to 100 parts for each 100 parts resin.\nIn place of the use of impregnated core material such as kraft paper, a non-bibulous rigid material such as masonite or plywood can be used. In this connection, the polyester resin overlay portion containing the disposed powdered glass and laminated to a colored face sheet 10 is laminated to the non-bibulous rigid material in following a modified continuous manufacturing process in forming the chalkboard. Such a product is diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 3 where the masonite base 16 is laminated with the face sheet 10 and overlay 17.\nUpon thorough testing of the chalkboards formed in the manner above described, it has been found that each product is provided with a good Writing surface of controllable color which is wear-resistant, solvent-resistant, resistant to corrosive chemicals, and non-fragile. The chalkboards are readily installed, available in continuous lengths and produceable at a moderate cost.\nObviously, many modifications and variations of the invention as hereinbefore set forth may be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, and therefore only such limitations should lbe imposed as are indicated in the appended claims.\nWe claim:\n1. A chalkboard formed from a polyester resin laminate and having a polyester resin overlay of a thickness not over 0.005 of an inch filled with reinforcing finely ground material, the exposed surface of said overlay being provided with a matte finish which is chalk-retaining while being readily eraseable, the polyester resin being the polymerization products of polyhydric alcohol esters of unsaturated dibasic acids.\n2. The chalkboard of claim 1 formed from bibulous cellulosic sheet material of uniform density impregnated with a polymerized flexible polyester resin.\n3. The chalkboard of claim 1 formed from bibulous cellulosic sheet material of uniform density impregnated with a polymerized rigid polyester resin.\nReferences Cited in the file of this patent UNITED STATES PATENTS 1,756,393 Snell Apr. 29, 1930 2,112,762 Chateld Mar. 29, 1938 2,264,244 Lytle Nov. 25, 1941 2,275,957 Groff Mar. 10, 1942 2,379,741 Palmquist July 3, 1945 2,452,235 Gold Oct. 26, 1948 2,496,911 Green Feb. 7, 1950 2,498,586 Smith Feb. 21, 1950 2,522,351 Egolf Sept. 12, 1950 2,528,152 Landgraf Oct. 31, 1950 2,541,497 Buxbaum Feb. 13, 1951",
    "summary": "614,47 9\n3 Claims.\n(Cl.\n35-66) The present invention relates to a new and improved type of chalkboard formed from bibulous sheet material impregnated with a solid organic plastic.\nMore particularly, the present invention is directed to the provision of an improved organic plastic chalkboard and process of forming the same, the chalkboard being made from polyester resins of a type to be described and provided with a polyester overlay surface portion which is internally reinforced by the inclusion therein of dispersed finely ground material.\nChalkboards are nowand have been primarily manufactured from slate, painted hardboard surfaces, opaque glass, and porcelain enameled metal.` Each of these basic types of chalkboards is objectionable in at least one respect either in connection with the manufacturing of the same or subsequent installation and use.\nSlate, for example, being limited to the well known black color, is somewhat limited in use due to its availability in only moderately sized sheets and, further, due to the difficulties encountered in installing the slate because of its relative fragility.\nStill further, slate, as in the case of all natural products, is quite variable in quality and this among other characteristics places slate in the category of expensive material.\nA\nPainted hardboard surfaces are readily prepared in any color and the manufacturing of the same is relatively simplied by use of a paint spraying process.\nPainted hardboard surfaces are inexpensive and readily available on the present market and, consequently, are widely used.\nWhile a good initial surface appearance can be obtained with this type of chalkboard, the surface is comparatively soft, as is common with many different types of painted surfaces, and consequently the painted hardboard surface has very limited resistance to Still further, various types of hardboard adapted for painting to provide a chank-retaining and eraseable surface are generally avaliable in sizes which are limited which restricts the usefulness of` this type of chalkboard.\nOpaque glass with one frosted face can also be made available in almost any color and is wear-resistant to a desirable extent.\nHowever, glass chalkboards of this type are limited in size, extremely expensive, fragile, and diliicult to install.\nPorcelain enameled steel with a matte surface exhibits substantially all of the Ydesirable characteristics of opaque glass while eliminating the undesirable characteristic of fragility.\nHowever, porcelain` enameling is an expensive process and has limited resistance to the action of corrosive chemicals.\nWith the advent and widespread use of organic plastics in `many different fields, efforts have been made to provide chalkboards molded or cast from thermoplastic resins lsuch -as polymethyl methacrylate for the purpose of improving on the physical and chemical properties of commercial forms of chalkboards.\nHowever, in the case of molded or cast thermoplastic resins ithas been found that themanufacture of chalkboards is overly exanstatt Fatented Oct.\n1l, 1960 pensive and these boards are limited as to size and are further unsatisfactory in connection with resistance to this cure.\nwear and solvents.\nHigh pressure laminates have been tested in connection with their suitability for use as chalkboards but the principal problem confronting these latter efforts resides in the provision of a uniform, satisfactory writing surface.\nStill further, chalkboards manufactured in this manner are limited in sheet size due to press limitations.\nWith continued investigations made in the organic plastic resin field, continuous processes such as those disclosed in United States Patent No.\n2,496,911 and United States Patent No.\n2,528,152 have been found capable of producing organic plastic laminates which are unlimited in size.\nIn continuously forming this type of laminate, polyester resins (hereinafter specified generally as polymerized polyhydric alcohol esters of unsaturated dibasic acids) have been utilized in the impregnating of the fibrous sheet material which is subsequently laminated in a continuous manner, the polyester resin being polymerized to a rigid or flexible thermoset structure without the evolution of any volatile by-product whatsoever.\nThe outstanding characteristic of the polyester resins resides in the non-volatile polymerization step which makes continuous production of laminates possible.\nWithout the presence of a volatile by-produ'ct it is unnecessary to apply pressure during the curing cycle such as is necessary in curing many other types of resins, as, for example, the phenolic, melamine and urea types.\nWhile it is `possible to manufacture continuous laminates or sheets from thermoplastic resins, such as the vinyls, polystyrene, methacrylates and cellulose acetate by extruding or coating with the molten polymer, these plastic materials are devoid of the surface hardness, wear resistance, dimensional stability, solvent and corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and permanency of the thermosetting resins such as the polyesters.\nA polyester resin for the purpose of the present invention is a complex product normally prepared by polymerizing the polyhydric alcohol esters of unsaturated dibasic acids.\nTypical polyhydric alcohols are ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerine, erythritol, pentaerythritol, butylene glycols, 'sorbitoL' and mannitol.\nTypical unsaturated dibasic acids are maleic, fumarie, and itaconic.\nThe properties of these resins may be modified to obtain variations in ultimate properties by the use of substituted polyhydric alcohols and unsaturated dibasic acids (those in which one or more hydrogen atoms per molecule have been replaced with another element or an organic radical), and by the replacement of a portion of the unsaturated dibasic acids with saturated dibasic acids, such as phthalic, terephthalic, adipic, sebacic, and tetrachlorophthalic, or with chlorendic acid which, though unsaturated, behaves like a saturated compound with respect to polymerization.\nBy these substitutions, resins which yield rigid, exible, lire-resistant or other properties may be obtained.\nResins of the type described may be either thermoplastic, as where the chain-like polymeric ester molecules are not connected to one another', or thermosetting, in the instance Where the chain-like polymeric polyester molecules are interconnected or crosslinked to one another.\nCommercial polyester resins are usually marketed in an incompletely polymerized form (liquid resin) by their manufacturers and users of these resins can then cure them by advancing the degree of polymerization in a laminating, casting or molding operation.\nAs previously described, no volatile by-products result during Crosslinking the liquid polyester resin molecules by means of monomeric unsaturated molecules such as styrene, methyl styrene, vinyl acetate and methyl methacrylate impart good physical properties to the resin.\nBecause of the generally better results obtained with styrene and the economic advantages inherent in its use, this crosslinking monomer is most commonly used.\nConsequently, the great majority of all commercially available liquid polyester resins are actually solutions of such resins in monomeric styrene.\nIn generally considering the continuous process of Patent No.\n2,496,911, bibulous sheet material is impregnated with liquid organic plastic, such as a polyester resin, and any desired number of plies of the impregnated sheet material are brought together to form a laminate in a continuous manner.\nThe sheet material used may include any natural or artificial material which exists in fibrous form to provide bibulous plastic reinforcement.\nReinforcements of prime importance are natural kraft papers, bleached kraft papers, cotton linters and purified alpha cellulose papers.\nTo be adapted for use in the continuous laminating process, the thicker core paper must preferably have better than average mechanical properties, be substantially uniform in caliper and composition, and have a pore structure that will allow for ready impregnation by the resin.\nThe facing sheet may be pigmented or otherwise colored depending upon the desired color of the final product and such pigmentation is readily observable due to the transparency of the polyester resins.\nOnce the desired laminate is formed, a nonbibulous sheet material is used to cover the exposed surfaces of the same so as to retain the shape of the laminated sheet during polymerization and, further, provide the exposed surfaces of the same with the type of finish desired.\nPolymerization is completed by the application of heat in any suitable manner such as disclosed in the above identified patent.\nIn using the continuous process it is possible to maintain a much closer tolerance in the over-all product as the material forming the product is passed through a set of combining rollers.\nOnce a roll setting is made, the material is uniformly handled throughout any one continuous area.\nThe resultant polyester laminate is readily adapted for many different uses.\nSuch uses include insulation, building materials, luggage covering, advertising displays, etc.\nAs the polyester resins contain no plasticizers, there is no volatile component to escape over a period of years, during the use of the laminate.\nStill further, due to the completion of polymerization and the presence of a thermoset state, subsequent change in the molecular structure does not take place and no change in physical properties are observable over an extended period of time.\nPolyester resin laminates are adapted to withstand elevated temperatures, are highly resistant to wear, and are resistant to a wide range of chemicals and food products.\nDue to the presence of the aforementioned desirable properties in polyester resin laminates, and, further, due to the adaptability of these laminates in being formed in a continuous manner thereby eliminating size restrictions, it has been found that by treating the polyester resin laminates in a manner to be described during the continuous formation thereof, a new and improved chalkboard can be continuously fabricated and formed.\nThe chalkboard exhibits the necessary desirable physical and chemical characteristics of existing chalkboards while at the same time overcoming or not exhibiting the various undesirable features or limitations presently encountered in the manufacture and use of chalkboards.\nIt is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved organic plastic chalkboard formed from a polymerized polyester resin reinforced with fibrous sheet material, which chalkboard exhibits over-all composite properties of an improved and lasting nature.\nA further object is to provide a new and improved polyester resin chalkboard laminate having a resin over- 4 lay surface portion internally reinforced with nely ground material, the exposed face of the overlay surface portion being provided with a matte finish which is chalk-retaining while being readily eraseable.\nAnother object is to provide a chalkboard formed from polymerized polyester resin reinforced with bibulous material and being provided with a polymerized resin overlay surface portion exhibiting the desired chemical and physical properties of an appropriate chalk-retaining and eraseable surface, the reinforced polymerized resin chalkboard being adapted for manufacture in either rigid or flexible form and being further readily adapted for mounting on any desirable backing material.\nStill a further object is to provide a new and improved chalkboard formed from polymerized polyester resin laminate provided with a polymerized polyester resin overlay surface portion in which is dispersed finely ground glass and the writing face of which is provided with a flat, uniform, dull finish which is smooth to the touch and which diffuses refiected light uniformly to eliminate observable glare even at a low angle of refraction.\nAn additional object is to provide a process of forming a polyester resin chalkboard laminate which includes steps which can be continuously followed so as to provide uninterrupted operation in the forming of continuous sheets of chalkboard-forming material.\nOther objects not specifically set forth will become apparent from the following detailed description.\nIn the accompanying drawing,\nFigs.\n1, 2 and 3 are enlarged diagrammatic sectional views of various forms of laminates of the types to be described.\nThe chalkboard of the present invention as previously described is formed from polymerized polyester resin which in its liquid state has been reinforced by one or more plies of bibulous sheet material and which further has been provided with an overlay surface portion of polyester resin throughout which has been dispersed finely ground reinforcing material.\nThe writing face of the chalkboard, being the exposed surface of the overlay portion, provides a wear and abuse-resistant writing surface which is easily erased and which has minimum shine or glare, both as manufactured and after extended continuous use.\nThis type of chalkboard is readily adapted for manufacture in a continuous manner as discussed above and as disclosed in the aforementioned patents.\nConsequently, any desired thickness of chalkboard may be produced and the chalkboard may be manufactured as either a rigid or resilient sheet in any desired color as will subsequently be described.\nChalkboards of this type are readily backed up with relatively inexpensive material such as masonite, plywood, etc.\nto obtain the structural rigidity required in use.\nThe chalkboard may be adhered to a backing in the factory and thus sold as mounted sheets or it may be applied to the backing at the site of installation so as to obtain the advantages of a continuous, joint-free writing surface.\nIn forming the chalkboard of the present invention any suitable process can be followed which will provide a reinforced polymerized polyester resin sheet provided with a polymerized polyester resin overlay having dispersed therein a quantity of finely ground reinforcing material such as glass.\nBy referring to glass it is intended to cover an amorphous transparent or translucent brittle material usually made by fusion of silica, soda ash and salt cake or similar materials.\nPreferably, the continuous types of processes disclosed in the above identified patents are basically used so as to overcome restrictions as to sheet size while at the same time provide uniformity of product.\nOne or more sheets of reinforcing or bulkproviding material, such as kraft paper, alpha cellulose paper or cotton linters, are impregnated with liquid polyester resin formulation.\nThis formulation may be either a rigid type polyesters resin or a flexible type polyester resin depending upon the physical characteristics desired in the end product.\nThe resin formulation will generally consist of a polyestervin styrene'solution and include a suitable polymerization catalyst such as a peroxide.\nThe thickness of the end product Will depend primarily upon the number of plies of impregnated sheets used and impregnation of these sheets may be brought about in any suitable manner.\nAs an example of obtaining impregnation, each sheet may be continuously run through a body of liquid polyester resin formulation and subsequently joined together in face-to-face relation to form a laminate.\nSome of the sheets may be impregnated and joined with unimpregnated sheets, the excess polyester resin formulation functioning to impregnate the additional sheets combined thereby.\nThis latter procedure is adapted for use where an extremely porous paper, such as cotton linters, is used as reinforcing paper.\nThe impregnated reinforcing sheets are combined by the use of rollers and the thickness of the laminated plies are controlled by the setting of the rollers.\nFollowing the formation of the laminate, a surface of the same is passed through a portion of liquid polyester resin formulation which has dispersed throughout therein finely ground glass or anyother suitable reinforcing, abrasive material.\nThus,` an o verlay surface portion which should not exceed 0L005 of an inch in thickness is applied to a surface of the uncured laminate, the thickness of the overlay portion being controlled by the passing of the treated laminate through a pair or pairs of rollers of a predetermined spaced setting.\nFig.\nl diagrammaticallyillustrates a laminate formed from a plurality of reinforcing plies 10, 11 and 12, the ply being a thin facing sheet of the type described in the examples below.\nThe top surface of the laminate is provided with an overlay portion 13 having dispersed within the same finely ground particles of glass.\nOf course, in the illustration of Pig.\nl the thickness of the overlay 13 is exaggerated to better illustrate the formation of the chalkboard of the present invention.\nAt this stage of the process a non-bibulous covering material is used to cover both the top and bottom of the laminate so as to encase the'same during polymerization of the polyester'resin formulation.\nThis arrangement is diagrammatically shown in Fig.\n2 where sheets 14 and are used to cover the laminate.\nThe non-bibulous encasing material in contactwith the exposed face of the overlay resin, such as the sheet 14 in Fig.\n2, should be parchmentized paper capable of providing the overlay resin with a surface nish essentially identical to the writing surface finish desired on the chalkboard.\nThe parchment used must have a uniform, matte surface, the degree of which is capable of providing a flat, uniform, dull surface on the overlay which feels smooth to the touch but diffuses reflected lightrso uniformly that no glare is apparent even at a low angle of refraction.\nThe parchmentized'covering material ,is plasticized-las,` for example, with glycerine and water, and must separate or peel from the finished product following polymerization of the polyester resin formulation.\nThis covering material m-ust also be essentially non-porous, be free of ropy areas, and have sufficient strength to carry the weight of the laminate through the ovens or other polymerization equipment.\nThe parchmentized paper must obviously be easily wetted by the liquid resin in order to provide the degree of matte desired.\nFollowing encasing of the laminate, the entire assembly is carried o n tenter clamps through a series of progessively hotter ovens in the event that the process described in Patent No.\n2,496,911 is followed.\nThe cured laminate issuing from the terminal end of the oven is stripped of its encasing webs and either wound into rolls or sheared to desired sheet lengths.\nIt may be passed through a sanding machine to roughen the back surface to make it more adaptable for cementing to a supporting surface with an adhesive which requires a roughened surface.\nIn the mounting of the laminate to a supporting base,\nany suitable type of adhesive may be used.\nDue to the uniformity of sheet manufacture and the provision of a completely fiat back surface, the laminated sheet may be readily applied to a substrate.\nPressure is required only to maintain contact with the glue line and if the glue line has a pronounced initial grab, as in the case of contact adhesives, no special pressure is necessary.\nFollowing the gluing operation, any excess laminate sheet material overhanging the edges or cutouts of the substrate may be rapidly trimmed with a file.\nArduous sawing often necessary in connection with the use of traditional chalkboard materials is thus entirely avoided.\nThe laminate sheet when formed from flexible polyester resin formulations may be readily coiled thereby allowing self-edging and further adapting the laminate sheet for mounting on contoured surfaces.\nThe polyester resin chalkboard may be adhered to plaster, wallboard, plywood, masonite, or any similar backing material either in wall-to-wall lengths or in segments, as desired.\nThe principal aspects of the chalkboard of the present invention reside in its adaptability for continuous manufacture and the presence of a unique surface which provides a wear and abuse-resistant writing surface that is easily erased and has minimum shine or glare, both as manufactured and after extended continuous use.\n`Such a surface is attained by the simultaneous use of a powdered-glass loaded overlay resin and a parchmentized paper of the correct texture.\nThe presence of the dispersed powdered glass provides an improved wear resistance and resistance to gloss-up which is not found in known types of organic plastic chalkboards.\nAny suitable nely ground reinforcing material, such as glass, capable of providing the requisite physical properties may be used.\nThe following examples are illustrative of the organic plastic chalkboard and process of forming the same of the present invention and should not be construed as being limiting with respect thereto:\nExample l A continuous sheet of green pigmented alpha cellulose paper having a thickness of approximately 0.008 of an inch was continuously impregnated with a peroxide catalyzed rigid polyester resin formulation consisting of approximately 65% of a glycol phthalate maleate and approximately 35%, styrene.\nAfter a.\nperiod of approximately 24 hours at 70 F., the thoroughly impregnated paperwas placed on a continuous laminator and, after passing through one or more dip pans containing a similar resin formulation, was laminated with one or more plies of lkraft paper which had also been passed through the same resin formulation `for pre-impregnation thereby.\nThe alpha cellulose paper formed the face sheet of the laminate which as illustrated in Fig.\n1 is the ply 10.\nImmediately prior to the combining rolls effecting the lamination, an excess of the same polyester resin formulation filled with fine powdered glass of approximately 50 parts glass to parts resin was applied to the top surface of the green facing sheet.\nOn passing through the combining rolls the overlay resin was evenly distributed at a uniform thickness of approximately 0.005 of an inch.\nSirnultaneously, the entire laminate including the overlay portion was encased top and bottom in non-porous parchmentized paper of the type capable'of providing the face of the ovelay resin with a matte finish.\nThe entire assembly was then carried on tenter clamps through a series of progressively hotter ovens in the manner described in Patent No.\n2,496,911.\nFollowing polymerization the laminate was stripped of its covering material and was sheared to desired sheet lengths.\nExample 2 A facing sheet of solid black alpha cellulose paper having a thickness of approximately 0.004 of an inch was preimpregnated with a catalyzed resilient polyester resin 7 formation consisting approximately of 25% of a glycol phthalate maleate and 50% styrene modied by 25% of a glycol adipate maleate.\nThe impregnated facing sheet was then laminated with a number of core sheets in the manner described in Example 1 with the exception that the powdered glass containing the overlay surface portion was formed from the same resilient resin formulation.\nParchmentized paper was applied to the top portion of the laminate to thus provide the top encasingweb.\nThe bottom encasing web was formed from glassine.\nFollowing polymerization as brought about in the same manner as described in Example 1, the parchmentized paper was stripped from the product and the glassine was removed by sanding.\nExample 3 Example 1 was repeated with the exception that the continuous process described in Patent No.\n2,528,152 was followed.\nAs described in this patent, a heated arcuate platen was used in completing polymerization of the polyester resin formulation.\nIn using the heated platen the laminated sheet was run with the overlay portion and facing sheet in contact with the top surface of the platen, the encased laminate being slidably moved over the platen to provide the desired ironing action while being advanced by rollers which maintained uniform tension on the covering sheets to retain the same in rm sliding engagement with the arcuate platen.\nIn referring to the examples it will be noted that a pigmented facing sheet was used in forming the chalkboard.\nThe polymerized polyester resins being transparent allow the use of pigmented facing sheets providing the chalkboard with any desired color.\nThus the chalkboard formed in accordance with the principles of the present invention may be made in many different colors to further improve the appearance of the chalkboard as well as adapt the Same for varied uses.\nThe glycol phthalate maleate is readily available commercially.\nTypical commercial resins are Selectron 5084 of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company and Paraplex P-43 of Rohm & Haas Company.\nThis type of polyester resin is normally sold in a styrene solution of approximately 70% resin and 30% styrene.\nditional styrene may be added as desired.\nThe usual technique includes the addition of sufficient styrene to obtain a viscosity that works well with the particular reinforcements under impregnation.\nSuch a viscosity falls generally within the range of about 200 to 1200 cps.\nThe Viscosity of the overlay resin will preferably be higher, such as within the range of about 5,000 to 25,000 cps.\nWith respect to the glycol adipate maleate, saturated dicarboxylic acids other than adipic may be used to attain a flexible resin, Paraplex P-13 of the Rohm & Haas Company is such a flexible polyester resin.\nIn formulating the flexible polyester resin the amount of flexible resin added to the rigid resin will vary depending on the For optimum viscosity and rate of reaction adrelative liexibility desired.\nGenerally, the amount of powdered glass used will fall within the range of about l5 to 100 parts for each 100 parts resin.\nIn place of the use of impregnated core material such as kraft paper, a non-bibulous rigid material such as masonite or plywood can be used.\nIn this connection, the polyester resin overlay portion containing the disposed powdered glass and laminated to a colored face sheet 10 is laminated to the non-bibulous rigid material in following a modified continuous manufacturing process in forming the chalkboard.\nSuch a product is diagrammatically illustrated in Fig.\n3 where the masonite base 16 is laminated with the face sheet 10 and overlay 17.\nUpon thorough testing of the chalkboards formed in the manner above described, it has been found that each product is provided with a good Writing surface of controllable color which is wear-resistant, solvent-resistant, resistant to corrosive chemicals, and non-fragile.\nThe chalkboards are readily installed, available in continuous lengths and produceable at a moderate cost.\nObviously, many modifications and variations of the invention as hereinbefore set forth may be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, and therefore only such limitations should lbe imposed as are indicated in the appended claims.\nWe claim:\n1.\nA chalkboard formed from a polyester resin laminate and having a polyester resin overlay of a thickness not over 0.005 of an inch filled with reinforcing finely ground material, the exposed surface of said overlay being provided with a matte finish which is chalk-retaining while being readily eraseable, the polyester resin being the polymerization products of polyhydric alcohol esters of unsaturated dibasic acids.\n2.\nThe chalkboard of claim 1 formed from bibulous cellulosic sheet material of uniform density impregnated with a polymerized flexible polyester resin.\n3.\nThe chalkboard of claim 1 formed from bibulous cellulosic sheet material of uniform density impregnated with a polymerized rigid polyester resin.\nReferences Cited in the file of this patent UNITED STATES

RICE, BRIDGEPORT, CONNECTICUT.\nBICYCLE.\nSPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 425,390, dated April 8, 1890.\nApplication filed February 6; 1890.\ntion of the invention, such as will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same.\nMy invention has for its object to provide a simple, durable, and inexpensive driving mechanism for bicycles which shall be so con structed as to make the driving-pulley selfadjusting to compensate for changes in the resistance to forward movement of the machine-that is to say, I so construct and or- 'anize the parts that Without movement or b eifort on cally increased at the expense of a reduction in speed when ever heavy roads or inclines are met in riding. I am thus enabled to obtain a much higher rate of speed upon firm level ground than has heretofore been possible, and at the same time reduce the speed automatically and apply much greater power to hill climbing and riding upon heavy roads than has been possible with any machine heretofore produced. These results I accomplish by the use, in connection with abelt to transmit power, of a yielding self-adjusting driving-pulley.\ngist of my invention lies, broadly, in the use in this connection of a yielding driving-pu1- ley, and that the special construction of the pulley -that is, the special manner in which it is made to adjust itself to the difierent requirements of light and heavy roads-is not of the essence of my invention. I have therefore shown several diiferent constructions of pulleys, all of which accomplish the desired result in a practical and satisfactory manner.\nIn order that others may fully understand my invention and the manner of its use, I will proceed to describe the same in detail, referring by numbers to the accompanying drawings, forming part of this specification, in which- Figure 1 is a side elevation of a bicycle with my novel driving mechanism applied the part of the rider the power avaib able to drive the machine shall be automati- It should be understood that the Serial No. 339,474.

It consists of two disks,\"which are so conder certain circumstances in use, so as to permit the wedge-shaped belt to move inward, thereby lessening the actual operative diameter of the driving-pulley, which necessarily acts to reduce the speed of the machine and to greatly increase the power that the rider is able to apply to the driven axle. The driving-axle is journaled in a suitable bracket .8 upon some rigid portion of the framework of the machine.\nInthe form illustrated in Figs. 1 to 5, inclusive, the disks of which the driving-pulley is composed are preferably stamped up from heavy sheet metal, although of course the special metal used is, unimportant so far as the principles of my invention are concerned. In this form one of the disks is rigidly secured to a collar 9, which is itself rigidly secured to the driving-axle, and the other is rigidly secured to a collar 10 on a sleeve 11, which is secured to the driving-axle by a pin 12, which passes through a hole in the axle with a drive fit, and through and beyond slots 13 in opposite sides of the sleeve, so that the sleeve must at all times rotate with the axle, although the axle, the disk attached directly thereto, and the cranks are permitted to move longitudinally, under certain circumstances presently to be explained, independently of the sleeve. The sleeve is held against endwise movement by screw-threaded collars 14, which engage corresponding screw-threads upon the sleeve, the curved inclines of the ball-bearings being formed, respectively, in said sleeve and collars, as clearly shown in Fig. 4. The disks of the driving-pulley are normally held approximately in contact, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, by means of a spring 16, one end of which bears against the ends of pin 12, which extend outward beyond the sleeve and the other end against a collar 15- 011 the sleeve, said collar being threaded to engage the sleeve and being held securely in position bythe pressure of the spring. Should it berequired at any time to change the adjustment of this springt-hat is, so that more or less power would be required to separate the disks of the driving-pulleyit may be done by shifting this collar upon the sleeve.\nThe operation of this portion of my invention is as follows: It will be seen that when increased resistance to forward movement of the machine is encountered it will first affect the driven axle and will cause the belt to drag sition.\non the driving-axle. The rider at this instant will naturally apply additional power to the driving-axle and driving-pulley to overcome the resistance. The combined effect of the increase of resistance to the rotation of the driven pulley and consequent drag of the belt, and the additional power applied to the driving-pulley to overcome the resistance, will be to overcome to a greater or less extent the power of spring 16, which holds the disks on the driving-axle together, thereby causing the belt to passinward farther between the disks structed as to yield outward or separate unand lessening the actual operative diameter of the driving-disk an amount determined by the excess of power applied to the drivingdisk by the rider over the'power of spring 16.\nIt will of course be understood that this spring is so adjusted that in use under ordinary circumstances, as when running upon level ground or when the resistance is slight, the power of the spring will be quite sutlicienttoovercome the tendency of the belt to wedge the disks apart, and consequently the normal diameter of the pulley will be maintained.\nThe instant the resistance to forward movement of the machine diminishes the rider naturally exerts less power upon the cranks. The tendency, therefore, is for the belt to move outward again, which permits spring 16 to force the movable disk back to its normal po- The driving-pulley is thus made selfadjusting to the work required.\n' In practice I find no difficultyin varying the speed from forty-five to sixty inches forward movement for each' revolution of the crank. It is of course well known that ordinary Safety bicycles are speeded to fifty-four inches forward movement for each revolution of the crank, a fifty-seven-inch gearing being occasionally used. A gearing of sixty inches forward movement, and even more, has been tried. The result has been, however, that there has been such a sacrifice of power as to render it difficult to force the machine up ordi-.\nnary grades, and, on the other hand, gearings giving but fifty inches forward movement, and even less, 'have'been tried. These 'low gearings give greater power, but at such a sacrifice of speed as to render the machine unsatisfactory for general use. My improvement, however, renders the driving-pulley self-adjusting to correspond with the resist ance to be overcome. I thus with a single simple mechanism obtain greatly-increased speed, except upon grades and heavy roads,\nand greatly-increased power when resistance is met with. In the form just described the driving-shaft itself moveslaterally,carrying one of the disks with it, the hub of the crank serving as a stop to limit the movement. (See at the right in Fig. 5.)\nIn Figs. 7 and '7 I have shown a style of self-adj usting driving-pulley in which the sleeve'and spring are dispensed with, two.\nspring-disks being used in lieu of a rigid disk and a spring-actuated disk.\ntwo disks are rigidly bolted between two col- In this form the IIO lars1'7, the outer edges of the disks them-' selves springing outward-that is, separating-when the resistance to rotation of the driven axle, and the consequent drag of the belt on the driving-pulley, has caused the;\nrider to increase the power applied to drive the machine sufficiently to overcome the spring action of the disks. In Figs. 8 and 9 the two disks are preferably cast, although may be made of sheet metal, if preferred. One of the disks is provided with a hub 18, which is rigidly secured to the axle, and with brackets 19, carrying rollers 20. The other disk is provided with a circular opening 21' they of just sufficient size to receive rollers 20, so\nthat this disk will turn on said rollers independently of the axle and the other disk. The two disks are connected together by links 22, ing pivoted to the respective disks. The disks are held at their normal position by means of a spring 16, the ends of which are attached to the disks, respectively,the action being to draw them toward each other, the\nlinks turning obliquely and lying in suitable.\nsockets 23 in the disks, the normal or closed position of the disks being shown at the right in Fig. 9 and the open position at the left in said figure. In this form, when increased power is applied to the driving-pulley to overcome resistance to forward movement of the machine, the action of the belt is to crowd the loose disk away from the fixed disk. This is accomplished by rotating the loose disk slightly upon rollers against the power of spring 16, said disk being free to separate,\nprovided the strain upon the belt is great enough to overcome the power of the spring to the full length of the linksthat is, until the links lie straight across between the disks, as at the left in Fig. 9. As soon as the excess of power upon the cranks is relieved the belt will move outward again, and the spring will act to rotate the loose disk backward, and the links will fall back obliquely into the sockets 23, in which they lie.\nThe form illustrated in Fig. 10 is somewhat similar to that illustrated in Figs. 8 and 9. The spring employed in this form, and which is not shown in the drawings, is just the same as in Fig. 8. In this form the loose disk is provided with cams 24, which are adapted to slide into recesses 25 in the fixed disk when the disks are at their normal position, as at the right in Fig. 10. The cams are provided with slots 26 and pins 27, driven through the solid material of the fixed disk, and the slots in the cam limit the outward movement of the loose disk and prevent the disks from being disconnectedunder anycircumstances. The operation in this form is precisely the same as in the form last described.\n28 denotes the driven pulley, which is rigidly secured to the hub 30 of the rear wheel, which is j ournaled on an axle 29, rigidly secured in the frame -work of the machine. The driven pulleyI do not make self-adjustthe opposite ends of said links being, but preferably make it in two parts, so\nthat it may be readily adjusted. These parts are denoted, respectively, (see Fig. 6,) by 28 and 28. One of these parts (see 28) maybe made integral with the hub, as shown in the drawings, or, if preferred, may be made separate and secured thereto in any suitable manner. The outer end of the hub is screwthreaded, and the other disk (see 28 is provided with a threadedhub engaging therewith. This disk may be fixed at any desired adjustment relatively to the other disk and locked there by set-screws 3 l, passing through the hub of the rear wheel, or, if preferred, by set-screws (not shown) passing through the hub of the loose disk. This adjustment of the driven disk I use when, for any reasonas, for instance, along run upon a smooth road, or possibly in racing-it is desired to obtain even a greater amount of speed than is possible upon a smooth road with the ordinary adjustment. It will be apparent that the principle is the same as with the drivingdisk, except that when the disks'are moved apart, thereby reducing the operative diameter of the driven disk, the result is an increase in speed, instead of an increase of power, as in the former instance. It will of course be apparent that when the diameter of the driving-disk is reduced, as when overcoming increased resistance to forward movement of the machine or when the diameter of the driven disk is reduced to give increased speed, the belt will be slackened, and consequently would run loosely and lose power unless the slack was taken up. In order to take up the slack of the belt to give increased hold upon the driven pulley, and also to enable me to dispense with belt-adjusting mechanism, I provide an idler 32, carried by an arm 33, which is free to turn on the rear axle. The exact details of construction of these portions of my invention may of course be varied greatly without departing from the principle thereof.\nThe construction of my preferred form is clearly illustrated in Fig. 2, taken in connection with Fig. 6. Arm 33 is rigidly secured to a collar 34:, which turns freely on the axle, this collar being on the inner side of the side piece of the frame-work, which I have de noted specifically by 1. The idler is kept continually in contact with the belt by means of a spring 35, acting against the arm by which the idler is carried. One end of this spring in my preferred form is connected to collar 34: (see Fig. 2) and the other end to an arm 36, the inner end of which is enlarged, (see dotted lines, Fig. 2,) and is provided with an -opening through which the rear axle passes. Outside of this arm is a plate 37, which is provided at its lower end with an inwardly-turned lug 38, against which arm 33 rests, and which acts as a'stop to limit the downward movement thereof. In order to provide a ready adjustment for this stop, I provide a curved slot 39 in said plate and lock it at any desired adjustment by means of ai bolt a0, passing through the slot and engaging side piece 1 of the frame-work. I\nArm 36 and plate 37 are locked in position on the axle by the usual nut 41. Should it be desired to adjust the tension of the spring, it is simply necessary to loosen nut 41 and, move arm 36 in either direction, as may be? required. To adjust plate 37 it is necessary to loosen both nut 41 andbolt 40. The partsj are locked in position after adjustment by f tightening the nut or bolt or the bolt alone, :5 as may be. In the form shown in Fig. 7 the! stop for arm 33 is dispensed with, and the arm? and idler are held in operative position by a ooil-spring42, one end of which is connected to said arm and the other to any suitable portion of the frame-work of the machine. j,\nAs already stated, I preferably use tllQOOIl-f; struction illustrated in Figs. 2 and 6 for the} reason that the parts are inexpensive to p'roduce, the spring is wholly out of'the way, and adjustments are provided to regulate the tenj sion of the spring and the oscillation of the arm carrying the idler.\nHaving thus described my invention, I; claim 1 1.

respectively, in the open and closed position, illustrating the construction and operation of the driving-pulley shown in Fig.\n8; and Fig.\n10, a vertical section and edge view illustrating still

arrangement as that shown in Fig.\n8.\n1 denotes the frame-work of the bicycle, which may be of any ordinary or preferred construction, as it is equally adapted to all of the various machines upon the market; 2,the front wheel; 3, the rear wheel; a, the drivlug-axle, and 5 the cranks.\nInstead of using sprocket-wheels upon the driving-axle and rear axle, as has heretofore been the almost universal custom in Safety bicycles, I use pulleys having V -shaped grooves upon both of said axles and transmit Fig.\n4, 6251- 'iCO 1 edges-inclined toward each other to correspond with the V-shaped grooves in the driving and driven pulleys,the engagement of the belt with the pulleys being wholly with its edges.\nThe driving-pulley as a whole I denote by 7.\nIt consists of two disks,\"which are so conder certain circumstances in use, so as to permit the wedge-shaped belt to move inward, thereby lessening the actual operative diameter of the driving-pulley, which necessarily acts to reduce the speed of the machine and to greatly increase the power that the rider is able to apply to the driven axle.\nThe driving-axle is journaled in a suitable bracket .8 upon some rigid portion of the framework of the machine.\nInthe form illustrated in Figs.\n1 to 5, inclusive, the disks of which the driving-pulley is composed are preferably stamped up from heavy sheet metal, although of course the special metal used is, unimportant so far as the principles of my invention are concerned.\nIn this form one of the disks is rigidly secured to a collar 9, which is itself rigidly secured to the driving-axle, and the other is rigidly secured to a collar 10 on a sleeve 11, which is secured to the driving-axle by a pin 12, which passes through a hole in the axle with a drive fit, and through and beyond slots 13 in opposite sides of the sleeve, so that the sleeve must at all times rotate with the axle, although the axle, the disk attached directly thereto, and the cranks are permitted to move longitudinally, under certain circumstances presently to be explained, independently of the sleeve.\nThe sleeve is held against endwise movement by screw-threaded collars 14, which engage corresponding screw-threads upon the sleeve, the curved inclines of the ball-bearings being formed, respectively, in said sleeve and collars, as clearly shown in Fig.\n4.\nThe disks of the driving-pulley are normally held approximately in contact, as shown in Figs.\n3 and 4, by means of a spring 16, one end of which bears against the ends of pin 12, which extend outward beyond the sleeve and the other end against a collar 15- 011 the sleeve, said collar being threaded to engage the sleeve and being held securely in position bythe pressure of the spring.\nShould it berequired at any time to change the adjustment of this springt-hat is, so that more or less power would be required to separate the disks of the driving-pulleyit may be done by shifting this collar upon the sleeve.\nThe operation of this portion of my invention is as follows: It will be seen that when increased resistance to forward movement of the machine is encountered it will first affect the driven axle and will cause the belt to drag sition.\non the driving-axle.\nThe rider at this instant will naturally apply additional power to the driving-axle and driving-pulley to overcome the resistance.\nThe combined effect of the increase of resistance to the rotation of the driven pulley and consequent drag of the belt, and the additional power applied to the driving-pulley to overcome the resistance, will be to overcome to a greater or less extent the power of spring 16, which holds the disks on the driving-axle together, thereby causing the belt to passinward farther between the disks structed as to yield outward or separate unand lessening the actual operative diameter of the driving-disk an amount determined by the excess of power applied to the drivingdisk by the rider over the'power of spring 16.\nIt will of course be understood that this spring is so adjusted that in use under ordinary circumstances, as when running upon level ground or when the resistance is slight, the power of the spring will be quite sutlicienttoovercome the tendency of the belt to wedge the disks apart, and consequently the normal diameter of the pulley will be maintained.\nThe instant the resistance to forward movement of the machine diminishes the rider naturally exerts less power upon the cranks.\nThe tendency, therefore, is for the belt to move outward again, which permits spring 16 to force the movable disk back to its normal po- The driving-pulley is thus made selfadjusting to the work required.\n' In practice I find no difficultyin varying the speed from forty-five to sixty inches forward movement for each' revolution of the crank.\nIt is of course well known that ordinary Safety bicycles are speeded to fifty-four inches forward movement for each revolution of the crank, a fifty-seven-inch gearing being occasionally used.\nA gearing of sixty inches forward movement, and even more, has been tried.\nThe result has been, however, that there has been such a sacrifice of power as to render it difficult to force the machine up ordi-.\nnary grades, and, on the other hand, gearings giving but fifty inches forward movement, and even less, 'have'been tried.\nThese 'low gearings give greater power, but at such a sacrifice of speed as to render the machine unsatisfactory for general use.\nMy improvement, however, renders the driving-pulley self-adjusting to correspond with the resist ance to be overcome.\nI thus with a single simple mechanism obtain greatly-increased speed, except upon grades and heavy roads,\nand greatly-increased power when resistance is met with.\nIn the form just described the driving-shaft itself moveslaterally,carrying one of the disks with it, the hub of the crank serving as a stop to limit the movement.\n(See at the right in Fig.\n5.)\nIn Figs.\n7 and '7 I have shown a style of self-adj usting driving-pulley in which the sleeve'and spring are dispensed with, two.\nspring-disks being used in lieu of a rigid disk and a spring-actuated disk.\ntwo disks are rigidly bolted between two col- In this form the IIO lars1'7, the outer edges of the disks them-' selves springing outward-that is, separating-when the resistance to rotation of the driven axle, and the consequent drag of the belt on the driving-pulley, has caused the;\nrider to increase the power applied to drive the machine sufficiently to overcome the spring action of the disks.\nIn Figs.\n8 and 9 the two disks are preferably cast, although may be made of sheet metal, if preferred.\nOne of the disks is provided with a hub 18, which is rigidly secured to the axle, and with brackets 19, carrying rollers 20.\nThe other disk is provided with a circular opening 21' they of just sufficient size to receive rollers 20, so\nthat this disk will turn on said rollers independently of the axle and the other disk.\nThe two disks are connected together by links 22, ing pivoted to the respective disks.\nThe disks are held at their normal position by means of a spring 16, the ends of which are attached to the disks, respectively,the action being to draw them toward each other, the\nlinks turning obliquely and lying in suitable.\nsockets 23 in the disks, the normal or closed position of the disks being shown at the right in Fig.\n9 and the open position at the left in said figure.\nIn this form, when increased power is applied to the driving-pulley to overcome resistance to forward movement of the machine, the action of the belt is to crowd the loose disk away from the fixed disk.\nThis is accomplished by rotating the loose disk slightly upon rollers against the power of spring 16, said disk being free to separate,\nprovided the strain upon the belt is great enough to overcome the power of the spring to the full length of the linksthat is, until the links lie straight across between the disks, as at the left in Fig.\n9.\nAs soon as the excess of power upon the cranks is relieved the belt will move outward again, and the spring will act to rotate the loose disk backward, and the links will fall back obliquely into the sockets 23, in which they lie.\nThe form illustrated in Fig.\n10 is somewhat similar to that illustrated in Figs.\n8 and 9.\nThe spring employed in this form, and which is not shown in the drawings, is just the same as in Fig.\n8.\nIn this form the loose disk is provided with cams 24, which are adapted to slide into recesses 25 in the fixed disk when the disks are at their normal position, as at the right in Fig.\n10.\nThe cams are provided with slots 26 and pins 27, driven through the solid material of the fixed disk, and the slots in the cam limit the outward movement of the loose disk and prevent the disks from being disconnectedunder anycircumstances.\nThe operation in this form is precisely the same as in the form last described.\n28 denotes the driven pulley, which is rigidly secured to the hub 30 of the rear wheel, which is j ournaled on an axle 29, rigidly secured in the frame -work of the machine.\nThe driven pulleyI do not make self-adjustthe opposite ends of said links being, but preferably make it in two parts, so\nthat it may be readily adjusted.\nThese parts are denoted, respectively, (see Fig.\n6,) by 28 and 28.\nOne of these parts (see 28) maybe made integral with the hub, as shown in the drawings, or, if preferred, may be made separate and secured thereto in any suitable manner.\nThe outer end of the hub is screwthreaded, and the other disk (see 28 is provided with a threadedhub engaging therewith.\nThis disk may be fixed at any desired adjustment relatively to the other disk and locked there by set-screws 3 l, passing through the hub of the rear wheel, or, if preferred, by set-screws (not shown) passing through the hub of the loose disk.\nThis adjustment of the driven disk I use when, for any reasonas, for instance, along run upon a smooth road, or possibly in racing-it is desired to obtain even a greater amount of speed than is possible upon a smooth road with the ordinary adjustment.\nIt will be apparent that the principle is the same as with the drivingdisk, except that when the disks'are moved apart, thereby reducing the operative diameter of the driven disk, the result is an increase in speed, instead of an increase of power, as in the former instance.\nIt will of course be apparent that when the diameter of the driving-disk is reduced, as when overcoming increased resistance to forward movement of the machine or when the diameter of the driven disk is reduced to give increased speed, the belt will be slackened, and consequently would run loosely and lose power unless the slack was taken up.\nIn order to take up the slack of the belt to give increased hold upon the driven pulley, and also to enable me to dispense with belt-adjusting mechanism, I provide an idler 32, carried by an arm 33, which is free to turn on the rear axle.\nThe exact details of construction of these portions of my invention may of course be varied greatly without departing from the principle thereof.\nThe construction of my preferred form is clearly illustrated in Fig.\n2, taken in connection with Fig.\n6.\nArm 33 is rigidly secured to a collar 34:, which turns freely on the axle, this collar being on the inner side of the side piece of the frame-work, which I have de noted specifically by 1.\nThe idler is kept continually in contact with the belt by means of a spring 35, acting against the arm by which the idler is carried.\nOne end of this spring in my preferred form is connected to collar 34: (see Fig.\n2) and the other end to an arm 36, the inner end of which is enlarged, (see dotted lines, Fig.\n2,) and is provided with an -opening through which the rear axle passes.\nOutside of this arm is a plate 37, which is provided at its lower end with an inwardly-turned lug 38, against which arm 33 rests, and which acts as a'stop to limit the downward movement thereof.\nIn order to provide a ready adjustment for this stop, I provide a curved slot 39 in said plate and lock it at any desired adjustment by means of ai bolt a0, passing through the slot and engaging side piece 1 of the frame-work.\nI\nArm 36 and plate 37 are locked in position on the axle by the usual nut 41.\nShould it be desired to adjust the tension of the spring, it is simply necessary to loosen nut 41 and, move arm 36 in either direction, as may be?\nrequired.\nTo adjust plate 37 it is necessary to loosen both nut 41 andbolt 40.\nThe partsj are locked in position after adjustment by f tightening the nut or bolt or the bolt alone, :5 as may be.\nIn the form shown in Fig.\n7 the!\nstop for arm 33 is dispensed with, and the arm?\nand idler are held in operative position by a ooil-spring42, one end of which is connected to said arm and the other to any suitable portion of the frame-work of the machine.\nj,\nAs already stated, I preferably use tllQOOIl-f; struction illustrated in Figs.\n2 and 6 for the} reason that the parts are inexpensive to p'roduce, the spring is wholly out of'the way, and adjustments are provided to regulate the tenj sion of the spring and the oscillation of the arm carrying the idler.\nHaving thus described my invention, I; claim 1 1.\nThe combination, with the driven pulley} of a bicycle, of a self-adj usting two-part

Stobbe, Ada, Ohio, assignor to'Ohio- Kentucky Manufacturing Company, Ada, Ohio Application March 1, 1952, Serial N6. 274,329 s Claims. ((21. ans) \"l i. The present invention relates to baseball gloves and is directed to a glove of novel contour and constructionparticularly adapted to be worn by players occupying those infield positions, other than'first 'bas e, where most of the batted balls that are fielded are rolling or bouncing upon the ground.\nAn object of the invention is to provide a baseball glove having greatly improved ball catching qualities due to the fact that two certain finger stalls of the glove are integrally joined together by a solid web and that web strengthened and reenforced in a novel manner by an interlaced thong.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide in a baseball glove having the foregoing characteristics, a dual finger construction that will func-. tion to initially snare and efi'ectively direct to the glove pocket a so-called \"ground ball which moves rapidly upon the ground and is best caught by a player wi h a scooping action of his gloved hand.\nA further object of the invention is to provide a baseball glove construction which will effectively protect a players second and third fingers from injury by reenforcing the particular finger stalls upon which a well caught, ground ball usually impinges before it enters the glove ball pocket.\nOther objects of my invention will appear from the following description and the accompanying drawings in which similar characters of reference indicate similar parts throughout the several views.\nIn the drawings:\nFig. 1 is a perspective view of the front or in baseball glove.\nFig. 2 is a perspective view of the rear of the glove depicted' in Fig. 1.\nFig. 3 is an enlarged section taken on line 3-3 of Fig. 1. r I\nFig. 4 is a section taken on line 4-4 of Fig. 3.\nIn the drawin the numeral 6 refers to a base ball glove comprising a palm piece 1 formed from an integral sheet of leather and including the front portion of a thumb stall 8 secured to the palm piece I by a welted seam 9. A composite back piece ill-is joined to the palm piece along its marginal edges partly by a welted seam l l and on the sides of the glove by integral leather portions, said pieces forming a thumb section l2 and a fingers section 13. As illustrated in Fig. 2 the composite back section is provided with the usual hand opening I4 and an adjustable strap l5. the margins of both being supplied with bound edges l6, saidback piece prejerably havin number of welted. seams l 'l extending from the bottom thereof up to, and meeting, thflwfilllfi seam 9 to secure together ajnumber of; forming sections. The bottom'e'dges of the'back and palm sections are bound and joined together by a laced seam l8, whilst the usual backstop l9 extends between, and is laced to, adjacent porf-i tions of the thumb and fingers sections. '-Ihe front and back pieces may have the usual-ii ings, at least one of which is shown at 20 inFig's. 3 and 4 as a palm piece liner, it being understood that padding is disposed between the piece and liner in such areas and in the amounts necessary to form the desired glove contour.\nThe portions of the palm piece 1 and the back piece I0 which form the fingers section l3 of the glove are provided with two aligned and laterally spaced open-topped slots 2| and 22 which extend heightwise from the glove ball pocket 230 and open out into the upper edge of the said fingers section. The slot 2| is spaced inwardly from the adjacent side of the fingers section to form with the adjacent side a first finger stall 23 for the glove, whilst the remaining slot 22 is spaced inwardly from the opposite side of the fingers section to form a smallfinger stal1 24. The palm and back pieces extend solidly between the opentopped slots 2| and 22 to form an intermediate, dual fingers stal1 25-46 between the first and small finger stalls. The dual fingers stall 25-26 are disposed in side-by-side relationship and are joined together by solid web portions 21 and 28 of the palm and back sections I and I0, respectively.\nA row of vertically spaced, aligned openings 29 and 30 are formed in. the web portions of the palm and back pieces respectively, said rows extending from the glove ball pocket to a point adjacent the top of the glove. A dual fingers stall reenforcing thong 3| is interlaced and drawn through the aligned openings 29 and 3B in the respective palm and back pieces of the glove, and. as most clearly shown in Fig. 3, the interlacing of the thong follows the so-called saddler stitch\" wherein corresponding portions of the thong are drawn through opposite sides of each pair of consecutive openings in the row, the center portion of the thong being passed through the lowermost pair of holes therefor. As best shown in Fig. 2 one lateral branch 32 of the thong is laced through the upper end of the dual finger stall 26 and extends across the open- topped slot 22 so that it lashes the small finger stall 24 to the dual fingers stall. The other lateral branch 33 is laced through the upper end of the dual finger stall 25 and connects it to the first finger stall 23.\nThe interlacing of the thong 3! through the row of vertically spaced openings in the palm and back pieces by the so-jcalled \"saddler stitch forms a reenforcing column which extends heightwise along the central part of the dual fingers stall 25-26 thereby strengthening the fingers section around the glove area where ground balls first impinge on the glove before being caught in the ball pocket 239. It will be noted'that the lateral branches 32 and 33 of the reenforcing thong 3| pass in opposite directions through the upper end of the dual fingers stall and thence to the respective finger stalls 23 and 24 to secure the dual stall to said adjacent finger 1 stalls. v Ball impact on the area of the dual fingers r stall, during the catching action, is therefore taken upon the interlaced column and transmitted by its thong branches 32 and 33 to the adjacent finger-stalls and 23 respectivelmand thus materially strengthens the glove at and around the dual fingers stall area for eficctive ball catching purposes.\n' What is claimed is:\n1. A baseball glove having a palm piece and a back piece joined along their marginal edges to forma thumb section and a. fingers section, the portions of the piecesforming the fingers section having two aligned and laterally spaced opentopp d'slotstherein extending heightwise from interlaced and drawn through the row of aligned openings in the web portions of said pieces.\n2. A baseball glove according to claim 1 characterized by the fact that the fingers reenforcing thong is drawn through opposite sides of each consecutive opening in the row.\n3. A baseball. glove according to claim 2 further characterized by the fact that the upper ends of the first and small finger stalls are each lashed to an adjacent part or the intermediate dual fingers; stall by lateral branches ofthe reenforcing thong.\n- BENJAMIN HSTOBBE.\nReferences Cited in the file of thispatent UNITED STATES PATENTS Number I Name r Date 2,281,315 Latina Apr. 23. 194?- 2,417,996 Stobbe Mar. 25, 1947 'Sonnett et a1 Nov. 2, 1948",
