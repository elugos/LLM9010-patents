    "description": "UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE.\nLAWRENCE W. LUELLEN, F NEWTON, MASSACHUSETTS.\nCUP.\nTo all whom it may concern:\nBe it known that I, LAWRENCE W. LUEL- LEN, a citizen of the United States, residing at Newton, in the county of Middlesex and State of Massachusetts, have invented a new and useful Cup, of which the following is a specification.\nIn the development of coin-controlled apparatus for dispensing beverages, for which I filed, on April 2, 1908, an application for Letters Patent, Serial No. 424,732, I have found it desirable to employ a cup, so organlzed and of such inexpensive material, that it may be automatically delivered by a vend ing machine from a. stock or supply with the l1qu1d contents, it being considered as included in the sale, to be thrown away or otherwise disposed of by the purchaser.\nThe object of the present invention is to provide a convenient cup or container for this or similar purposes.\nIn the accompanying drawing, in which similar parts are. designated by the same characters throughout the several views, Figure 1 shows a side elevation of one embodiment of my invention; Fig. 2 is a top plan View thereof, and Fig. 3 illustrates a plurality of the cups nested as they would be in the supply, ready for use.\nMy improved cup, designated as a whole by the character C, is preferably formed from water-proof paper, this material being resilient, cheap and sufficiently durable for nest closely, as illustrated in Fig. 3,-a great number thus placed extending but a little the length andcharacter of the service which the article'is to perform. It has a tapering side wall 10 and a flat bottom portion 11, which may be assembled and secured in any desired manner, the, method of making not playing a part in the present invention.\nThe frusto-conical 'form and the comparative thinness of the wall lOallows the cups to distance, yet the edges about the openings of successive cups in the nested ser1es are separated by definite though narrow spaces m.\n' Adjacent to the opening ofeach cup is a I projection which I prefer to furnish by a continuous flange l2iYftegral with the wall 10, it consisting of a single thickness of the paper turned over and ly ng substantially in the plane of the edge,\nthat 1s, at right angles to the longitudinal axisof the cup but forming an obtuse angle with the side wall.

This alone'would determine that the angle which the flange forms with the .flan e to the side wall. The natural position wall should not be more obtuse than that existing when the flange is at right angles to the cup-axis. Furthermore, as the flange passed this plane, or approached coincidence with the inclination of the wall, it would offer less resistance to being further bent in the same direction, diminishing its effectiveness as an engaging means. On the other hand, it may be desired that after the cup has been thus seized, it shall be inverted and filled with liquid, and that the weight of the cup and contents shall then withdraw it from the engaging mechanism by bending or straightening out the flange. so, to avoid undue resistance to such release, the angle of the flange with the cup-wall should not be less obtuse than ninety degrees with re- This fixes the angle of spect to the axis. maximum effectiveness at the intermediate position already described. The flange also strengthens the cup, and, because o'f its per- \"pendicular position with respect to the axis,\noffers the greatest resistance to lateral crushing stresses with a minimum of material and of labor in forming. In this connection there should be noted the peculiar cooperationbetween the cups when nested and theirf i flanges. Each cup as then strengthened, not only by its own flange but by those of a con siderable number of other cups which surround it. Consequently, when arranged in a series, the cups may be more safely forced together and handled. The overlapping cups of the series also tend to maintain the true circular cross-section of the terminal cup, and thus prevent its flattening by the inward spring of the sides and slipping out of the engaging means when the latter is drawing it from the stock. But after the separation of the cup from its fellows the lateral compression acts with the bending of the flange to aid in release.\nHaving thus described my invention, I claim and desire to secure by Letters Patent:\n1.

A drinking. cup for use in connection With vending machines made of thin flexible paper having a narrow flange integral therewith around its open end, the flange forming an unbroken uniform part of the body of the cup.

The papers to be bound are perforated near one n with the perfor- ations 7 in the hinged strip 6 and the two ends of the cord are passed through the papers. 9 is the other cover, same being provided with a hinged strip 10. ln the preferred form of construction the hinged strip is sufficiently removed from the cover, or the hinge to the strip 10 is suliiciently wide that the hinged strip can be turned over on the cover and lie parallel .and in Contact therewith.\nThus when the papers are in position the hinged strip will turn inward andv be inclosed by `the cover, as shown in Fig. 1. This method of `concealing the binder-cord is well known in this art and can be embodied in or omitted from my binder, as desired. It will be evident that if there is no objection to having the ends ofthe cord visible the cover 9 can be turned around so that, when the binder is closed, it lies in the same plane with the strip 10, instead of covering saine in the parallel plane, and yin such case, of course, the ends of visible.\nThe cords pass through perforations 11 in the strip 10 and are secured in place by sheet metal spring-clips, whose construction is quite clearly shown in Fig. 4.

GIMERA ET AL 2,032,695\nPOCKET LIGHTER Filed May 1'7, 1954 INVENTORS Err-Easels M M fl7hii Patented Mar. 3, 1936 UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE POCKET LIGHTER sisting of- George G.\nBlaisdell, W. G. Blaisdell,\nFrank W. Calkins, George Gimera, and George B. Morris Application May 17, 1934, Serial No. 726,022 lClaim. (crew-7.1)\nThis invention relates to pocket lighters of the hinged cover type.\nPofzket lighters having covers hinged on their upper endsmust have means for holding them closed it they are to be satisfactory, and it is also desirable that they have means for preventing the covers from closing prematurely and extinguishing the flame after they are opened. In lighters known heretofore these means take the form of exposed latches and interior springs and levers which take up space in the lighters and reduce their storage capacity for inflammable lighter fluid. Furthermore, the exposed latches are apt to catch in and wear the clothing, to be accidentally actuated in the pocket, and to accumulate dirt. Such lighters are complex and frequently get out of order, while they must be constructed in a cheap manner in order to be salable at a low price.\nIt is among the objects of this invention to provide a pocket lighter having a minimum of projections from its closed case, and in which movement of the cover from either its fully open or its fully closed position is restrained by simple means concealed when the lighter is closed.\nFurther objects are to provide such a lighter having large storage capacity for lighter fuel, which is easy to flll, is strong and durable, and is simple in design and construction with a minimum of moving parts.\nThe preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawing, of which Figs. 1, 2 and 3 are, respectively, perspective, side and top views with the cover open; Fig. 4 is a central vertical section through the lighter with its cover closed; and Fig. 5 is a side view with the cover closed.\nReferring to the drawing, a casing is provided consisting of two telescopically disposed hollow members, the inner member I being substantially coextensive with the outer member 2 and having a very snug sliding fit therewith. The outer member is closed at its lower end. A top plate 3 closes the upper end of inner member I, which is preferably formed from a section of seamless tubing. This forms in the casing a reservoir for inflammable lighter fuel, such as gasoline, which is carried by a stuiflng of saturated cotton waste.\nThe upper edges of the side walls of the inner member are provided with upright integral extensions, the central portion 4 of each having its sides curved inward over the top plate toward the opposite extension to form a generally elliptical wind screen in which a plurality of draft openings 6 are punched (Figs. 1 and 3), These curved sides are likewise provided with integral extensions or lugs l and 8 disposed in pairs at the front and rear, respectively, of the wind screen, the lugs of each pair being disposed in spaced parallel relation longitudinally of top plate 3.\nIn the front pair of lugs I there is journalled a toothed wheel 9 which engages the upper end of an elongate flint H slidably disposed in an opening through top plate 3. The flint is con- 10 stantly held in frictional engagement with the toothed wheel by a coil spring l2 (Fig. 4) compressed between the bottom of the flint and a set screw l3 threaded in the lower end of a tube l4 depending from top plate 3. The toothed wheel is adapted to throw sparks, when rotated by the thumb, from the flint to a wick l6 surrounded by the wind screen and projecting into the fuel reservoir through a hole in top plate 3.\nIn order to protect the projections at the top of the casing, as well as the clothing, the casing is provided with a cover l8 which is connected at its rear wall to the rear wall of outer telescoping member 2 by means of a small hinge l9. As will be observed in Fig. 5 of the drawing, there are no projections from the lighter other than this hinge when the cover is closed. However, as it is desirable that the cover remain closed except when the operator opens it, means is provided for accomplishing this object without exposing anything which might catch in and wear the pocket or he accidentally actuated.\nAccordingly, a lever 21 is plvotally mounted at one end between the rear pair of lugs 8 so that it can be swung from an upright position, as shown in Fig. 4, to a substantially horizontal position, as shown in Fig. 2, and vice versa. The lever resists movement from both its upright and horizontal position because its pivoted end is provided with a laterally projecting toe portion 22 which must depress a spring- biased plunger 23, slidably disposed in an opening through top plate 3, as the lever moves from one of said positions to the other. The spring 24, which biases the plunger against the pivoted end of the lever radially of its pivot axis, is compressed between the bottom of the plunger and the lower end of a closed tube 26 secured in the inner telescoping member I. When the lever is substantially upright the pressure of the plunger against the under side of toe 22 biases the lever toward the wind screen (Fig. 4).\nWhen the cover is closed it is held in that position by the upright lever bearing against the rear side of a cross member 21 secured in the 65 cover transversely thereof adjacent its rear wall (Fig. 4). As the cover is swung open by the thumb, cross member 21 swings the lever backward and downward, toe 22 depressing the plunger against the resistance of spring 24 as the toe slides over the plunger. Continued movement of the lever causes the end of the toe to slip of! the plunger, whereupon the latter quickly rises and snaps the lever togts horizontal position, as shown in Fig. 2, the outer end of the lever snapping against the rear wall of the cover which is thereby thrown wide open.\nSelf-closing or premature closing of the cover is prevented by this rear wall striking the end of the lever whose upward and forward movement the plunger and toe 22 cooperate in restraining. However, the cover is easily closed by the operator by applying sufiicient pressure to it to cause the toe to overcome the resistance of spring 24 when the lever is swung upward by the rear wall' of the cover. Once again, as the end of the toe slips off the plunger the latter is forced upward against the under side of the toe and snaps the lever against cross member 21 which causes the cover to swing shut (Fig. 4).\nBesides being a lighter which has a cover operated in the above-described manner with no parts projecting beyond the closed case except a hinge, it has a larger storage. capacity for lighter fuel than lighters now known having the same over-all area that this one has. Unobstructed access to the fuel reservoir is readily gained by merely grasping the wind screen and pulling the two telescoping.- members apart. There are no screw plugs to remove or become lost, nor small openings through which to attempt to introduce the lighter fuel. The snug sliding fit of the telescoping members insures a leaf-proof reservoir.\nThe projections on top of the inner member I are strong and well constructed, because the wind screen and the wheel-supporting and leversupporting lugs are all integral with the inner member, and not separate parts soldered in place and apt to break off. This integral structure also simplifies the manufacture of the lighter and decreases its cost. Finally, this lighter is provided with a minimum of moving parts, thereby obviating the possibility of its getting out of order.\nAccording to the provisions of the patent statutes, we have explained the principle and operation of our invention, and have illustrated and described what we now consider to represent its best embodiment. However, we desire to have it understood that, within the scope of the appended claim, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically illustrated and described.\nWe claim:\nA pocket lighter comprising a hollow member having a closed bottom and an open top, a second hollow member telescoped therein, and having an open bottom, a plate permanently closing the top of the inner member whereby areservoir for inflammable fuel is formed, the side walls of the inner member projecting above said plate and being formed to provide a wind screen and front and rear pairs of lugs, a cover disposed over the tops of said telescoping members and hinged at its rear wall to the outer of said members, a cross member secured in the cover transversely thereof adjacent said rear wall, a .lever pivotally mounted at one end between said rear pair of lugs with its opposite end projecting up between said rear wall and cross member and engaging the latter, a spring biased plunger slidably disposed in said top plate for biasing the lever against the cross member, whereby movement of the cover from its closed position is restrained, and a flint-engaging toothed wheel pivotally mounted between said front pair of lugs, the lighter being free of external latch-manipulating means.\nGEORGE GIMERA.\nGEORGE G. BLAISDELL."

In Great Britain February Claims.\nThis application relates to composite yarns containing yarn having a basis of continuous filaments but having the appearance of spun yarn, i. e. of yarn made from staple fibre, and fabrics made therefrom. The application is in part a continuation of our co-pending application S. No. 746,258 filed 29th September, 1934, now Patent No. 2,077,4 i1, which is in part a continuation of our application S. No. 712,120 filed th February, 1934, itself acontinuation-in-part of our application S. No. 652,780, filed 21st January, 1933, now Patent No. 1,959,142 issued 15th May, 1934.\nAccording to the invention yarns are made by twisting or doubling a plurality of individual strands or yarns at least one of which is composed of short lengths of fibrous material and at least one other of which is an imitation spun yarn or stapilized yarn, and the invention includes fabrics made from these mixed yarns.\nThroughout the specification and claims the term \"regular yarn is used to mean yarn formed by associating a plurality of substantially continuous filaments, and the term spun yarn is used to mean yarn formed by spinning relatively short lengths of filaments or fibres. The stapilized yarn employed in making yarns according to the invention is formed by any suitable method from regular yarns by cutting, breaking or tearing operations so carried out that at any point in its length one or more of the filaments in the bundle of filaments constituting the yarn are severed and one or more of the filaments in the bundle remain unsevered and the continuity of the bundle as a whole is not affected. For example the methods described in U. S. Patents Nos. 1,956,600, 1,959,142, 2,031,647, 2,044,130 and 2,046,615 maybe employed or the stapilized yarns may be formed by the methods described in U. S. Patents Nos. 2,098,980, 2,096,795, 2,098,-\n981 and 2,077,283.\nThe stapilized yarn may be formed from any desired, regular yarn, for example, yarn of cellulose acetate or other organic derivative of cellulose, e. g. other cellulose esters such as cellulose formate, propionate and butyrate and cellulose ethers such as methyl cellulose,ethy1 cellulose and benzyl cellulose; yarn of wholly or partially and uniformly or intermittently saponified organic esters of cellulose; yarn of regenerated or reconstituted cellulose such as viscose, nitrocellulose or cuprammonium artificial silk; natural silk yarns; and yarns consisting of a mixture of any two or more of these types, according to the effect desired in the mixed yarn. The stapilized yarn ay be, for example, lustrous, weighted and/or pigmented. The number of filaments employed in theformation of the stapilized yarn may be from 10-200 or more and the denier of the yarns may be, for example, from 75-300 with any desirercli degree of twist from 3-20 or more turns per mc The spun yarns may be formed by any suitable method of spinning staple length fibres, e. g. by the worsted method, the woollen method, the French method or the cotton method. Fibres which constitute these yarns may be, for example, cotton or wool fibres. or artificial fibres, e. g. cellulose acetate staple fibre. and preferably are wool fibres having a staple length between 2 and 8 inches of a grade between 54s and 72's. If desired staple length fibres of cellulose acetate or other organic derivatives of cellulose may be mixed with wool or cotton to form the spun yarn. The spun yarns may be of any suitable size and of any desired degree of twist, although it is gen.- erally preferable to employ spun yarns having a count of 20-60 with a twist of 1120 turns per inch.\nWith the stapilized and spun yarns-there may be associated regular yarns, which may, for example, be formed by associating from 3 or 10 to 100 or 200 or more continuous filaments of the nature of those used in the regular yarns de-- scribed above in connection with the formation of the stapilized yarns. The constituent filaments of these regular yarns may be associated with substantially no twist or with a twist of up to 50 or more turns per inch.\nThe composite yarn may be formed by twisting or doubling together stapilized yarns and spun yarns in any desired ratio; for example, one spun yarn may be twisted with one stapilized yarn or with 2, 3, 4 or more stapilized yarns.\nThe composite yarns may be formed from the several constituent yarns by twisting to an extent of, for example, 3-15 turns per inch. The twist imparted in the twisting or doubling operation may be in the same direction or in the opposite direction to the twist of the yarns forming the individual components. Furthermore, spun yarn having a right-hand twist may be doubled with stapilized yarn having a left-hand twist, the two components being twisted together with either a left or right-hand twist.\nThe composite yarns made as described above may be woven, knitted, knotted or netted into fabrics. These fabrics are wool-like in appearance and possess characteristics which render them particularly well suited for mens summer and winter suits and for women's light and heavy- Attractive fabrics may be woven from the composite yarns of the invention, for example, in plain 1:1 weave or in patterns, herring bones, basket weaves and the like. The fabric may contain any desired number of warp ends or picks. Thus, for example, fabric may be woven in a plain 1:1 weave having from 35-45 warp ends and from 30-45 picks.\nAfter formation the fabric may be finished and dyed in the usual manner. over, that fabrics containing thecomposite yarns of the invention are exceptionally well suited to napping operations by brushing the surface of the formed fabric. The fabrics are also noteworthy for their good draping powers, especially when containing regular yarns of organic derivatives of cellulose in addition to the spun yarns and stapilized yarns of organic derivatives of cellu1ose. I\nThe following example illustrates the invention but is not to be regarded as limiting it in any way:- I\nExample A composite yarn is formed by twisting together with 8 turns right-hand twist, 3 ends of a 170 denier pigmented stapilized yarn having a twist of turns right-hand, and a spun worsted- -woolen yarn having a count of 40 and a twist of 14 right-hand turns per inch. The' resulting composite yarn is woven into a fabric with a plain 1:1 weave having 42 warp ends and 34 picks.\nHaving described our invention, what we desire to secure by Letters Patent is:-\n1.,A composite yarn containing at least one spun yarn and at least one stapilized yarn.\n2.

Carlson, Chicago, Ill., assignor to The Boye Needle Company, Chicago, 111., a comaration of Illinois Application November 1, 1949, Serial No. 124,870\n2 Claims. (01. 66-118) This invention relates to a crochet hook or the like.\nIn the manufacture of crochet hooks, it has heretofore been the practice to employ a hook or beak connected by a cylindrical throat or stitch-forming neck to the main body of the hook. The side faces of the head of the hook or beak are bulging and rounded so as to merge with the rounded walls of the neck or stitchforming throat. Such a structure is illustrated in my patent No. 2,024,794.\nWhile the foregoing structure is a desirable structure, I have discovered that .the movement of the stitches onto and off of the hook is surprisingly improved by making the sides of the head and preferably also the throat portion of the structure flat. Thus the side Walls of the throat and head form a substantially continuous taper and with relatively wide and flat side faces.\nAn object of the invention is to provide a crochet hook having flattened side faces on its head. A further object is to provide a crochet hook having a body portion tapering at its front toward a hook head and with the sides of the head and tapered portion flattened. Other speciflc objects and advantages will appear as the specification proceeds.\nThe invention is illustrated in a single embodiment, by the accompanying drawing, in which- Figure 1 is a perspective view of a crochet hook embodying my invention; Fig. 2, a broken enlarged side view in elevation; Fig. 3, a top plan view; and Fig. 4, a transverse sectional view, the section being taken as indicated at line 4-4 of Fig. 2.\nIn the illustration given, in designates 2. cylindrical crochet hook body which, if desired, may be flattened in a horizontal plane at H. Forwardly of the flattened portion I I, the structure is provided with a tapering stitch-forming portion or throat l2 which merges into the head [3. The head I3 is provided with a beak M which preferably extends rearwardly, as illustrated more clearly in Figs. 2 and 3.\nIn the structure shown, I prefer to form the crochet hook structure at its forward end with flat side walls I5 and it. The flattened side walls may extend across the entire outer portion of the head and preferably also extend rearwardly along the neck or throat portion 12 of the hook. If desired, the top portion of the throat l2 may be flattened as indicated at H in Fig. 3. Further, if desired, the top portion 2 of the throat may be left rounded and the sides of the head and throat only flattened in the vertical plane.\nIn the operation of the hook, the stitches are formed as in the usual practice, by the flattened sides which are found to give a much smoother and faster crocheting operation. Why the stitches move so readily and quickly along the crochet hook, I am unable to say with definiteness but it is a fact that the flattened side walls of the head and neck or throat of the structure enable the stitches to be moved in either direction with great speed and smoothness and the crocheting operation is greatly speeded up. It may be that the greatest point of frictional resistance in the crocheting operation has been along the sides of the head and throat and that by providing these surfaces with relatively wide flat areas that the stitches work against a much smaller area of resistance and slide much more easily over such surfaces.\nIn the operation of the hook, a stitch is drawn onto the hook and the hook then passed through the material to engage in the thread. In so doing, the stitch-forming throat or portion I2 preforms the loop so that it may be readily slipped over the head and then the new stitch is drawn forwardly. In this operation, a minimum of frictional area engages the loop that is being formed so that it slides very readily over the head, etc.\nWhile in the foregoing specification I have set forth a structure in considerable detail for the purpose of illustrating one embodiment of the invention, it will be understood that such details of structure may be varied widely by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of my invention.\nI claim:\n1. In a crochet hook, a main body portion of generally circular cross section and provided at one end with a tapered portion terminating in a head, said head being provided with a beak, said tapered portion being rounded on its bottom side and provided on its upper side adjacent said beak with a widely flattened upper wall portion terminating at its end opposite said beak in a pointed area within said body end, said head and end portion being flattened along their sides to provide flat side walls intersecting the flattened upper wall of said end except at the pointed portion of said flattened upper wall portion.\n2.

Y., assignor to Superior Sewing Machine & Supply Corporation, New York, N. Y., a corporation of New York This invention relates to an improved thread cutting attachment for a sewing machine.\nAfter a garment or other textile article has been fed rearwardly under the presser foot and needle of a sewing machine, it is necessary to cut the. thread trailing from the garment before the next garment can be fed through the machine. It is then customary to lift the garment and move it back to the front of the machine for further sewing operations or for stacking purposes. An important object of this invention is to provide an attachment for a sewing machine, whereby afterthe garment has been fed past the needle to the rear of the machine, the thread may be automatically cut merely .by moving the garment upwardly and then forwardly to the front of the machine. As a result, the improved attachment eliminates the need for any extra operation on the part of the operator in order to cut the thread.\nAnother important object of this invention is to provide a thread cutting attachment for sewing machines which has a cutting edge instantly ready for use at the conclusion of the sewing of the garment, but which is always protected so as to prevent the possibility of accidental injury to the operator.\nAnother important object of this invention is to provide a thread cutting attachment for sewing machines which also grips or holds the thread after it has been cut, thereby preventing the needles from becoming unthreaded and preventing the thread from becoming slack.\n\"ice\nto the machine is automatically held between turns of the spring. This eliminates any need for the operator to manipulate the thread prior to the sewing of the next garment.\nOther objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description in conjunction with the annexed drawing, in which a preferred embodiment of the invention is disclosed.\nIn the drawing, Fig. l is an end view of a conventional sewing machine, showing ,the improved attachment mounted thereon, and showing by means of an arrow, the front-to-rear direction of feeding of the cloth underthe presser foot.\nFig. 2 is a view similar to Fig. 1, but showing the manner in which the cloth is moved, after completion of the sewing operation, so as to withdraw the cloth and at the same time out the thread.\nFig. 3 is a top plan view of my improved attachment.\nFig. 4 is a section on line 44 of Fig. 1.\nFig. 5 is a section on line 55 of Fig. 4.\nFig. 6 is a section on line 66 of Fig. 5.\nUpon reference to the drawing in detail, it will be noted that it shows a conventional sewing machine having a casing 10, a depending presser foot 11, and 9. depending needle 12 and needle holder 13. These parts are all conventional and are accordingly not shown or described in detail.\nFig. 4 shows post 14 depending from casing 10, and the U-shaped presser fot shank 11a fixed to post 14 bymeans of screw 15 in the usual manner. As is well known, said post 14 may be raised and lowered within casing 10 so as to raise and lower presser foot 11.\nFig. 1 also shows cloth 16 being fed under the presser foot and needle and above the usual anvil 17, in a frontto-rear direction, as indicated by arrow 18.\nThe attachment 20 may be made of any suitable material, such as iron in scrap form, which is-bent to the This permits the next garment to be sewed with a minimum of delay.\nIn accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the attachment consists simply of a bracket adapted to be mounted upon the presser foot of the sewing'machine and having an arm located rearwardly of the presser foot and above the cloth being fed from front-to-rear under the presser foot. The arm extends cross-wise of the direction of travel of the cloth, and a knife is mounted on the arm with the cutting edge of the nife located behind the rear edge of the arm. Also in accordance with said preferred embodiment, a spirally wound coil spring is mounted upon said arm with said arm and said knife extending through the bore of the coil spring. Said spring is mounted on the bracket so as to be maintained under compression, so as to hold its turns quite close to each other, but with sufficient spacing therebetween to permit the entry of thread between the successive turns.\nIn use, the garment is fed past the presser foot and under the knife, and is then lifted by the operator upwardly and over the knife and withdrawn to the front of the machine. Since the trailing thread is being pulled from the machine, the thread is thus automatically drawn through successive turns of the spring and against the cutting edge of the knife, so that the thread is automatically severed.\nAs an important feature of the invention, the spacing and tension of the spring is maintained, so that after the thread is severed, the end of the thread which leads back desired shape. Said attachment includes a bracket which is of angular shape and which also extends vertically. Said bracket has a horizontally and vertically extending frontarm 20a having any suitable opening so that it may be secured to the end face of presser foot shank 11a by means of the same screw 15 which is used to secure said presser foot shank 11a to the post 14. Rearwardly of presser foot shank 11a said bracket 20 has an offset arm 20b which extends vertically and laterally inwardly from bracket arm 20a. The inner end of offset 20b connects with a further bracket arm 200 which extends vertically rearwardly from offset 20b. The rear end of bracket arm 20c connects with a further bracket arm 21. This bracket arm 21 extends vertically and also extends laterally outwardly from bracket arm 200. Accordingly, said bracket arm 21 extends cross-wise of the direction of travel of cloth 16 and is located above the cloth. A knife holding flange 22 is integral with arm 21 at the upper edge thereof and extends rearwardly therefrom. Said flange 22 extends horizontally and is of a width approximately equal to the height of arm 21. Accordingly, it will be apparent that the bracket 20 may be readily formed by appropriately binding a metal strap.\nA knife blade 23 is fixed to the lower face of flange 22, by means of a central rivet 24, or by any other suitable means. Said blade 23 is of slightly less length than the length of arm 22, but is of greater width, so that said blade 23 projects rearwardly of the rear edge of arm 22. The rear edge 23a of blade 23 is sharpened so that it may serve as a cutting edge for the thread.\nSaid blade 23 may be made of any suitable material and is optionally made similarly to a single edged razor blade.\nA spirally wound coil spring 25 is mounted upon arms 21 and 22 with said arms 21 and 22 extending through asevgt's t the central bore of'spring 25.- The inner turn of spring 25 abuts arm 200 which serves as a stop. An aperture is formed in the outer end of arm 21, adjacent the outer side edge thereof, and the' outer end 25a of'sprin'g'25 is extended through saidaperture. Said spring 25 is held under compressionwith its successive turns fairly close to each other. 7\nBy reason of the location ofthe end- 25a ofspring 25 within the aperture at the lower outer corner of arm 21, spring 25 may be maintained with the lower edge of arm 21 adjacent the spring and with the knife edge 23a adjacent the spring. This reduces-the necessary movemerit of the thread'within the turns of the spring, in order that the thread may becuti a .Fig. 2-shows the manner in which the attachment may be used to cut thread. Fig. 2 shows the cloth 16 having a line of stitching 161 formed bythread 30. As shown in Fig. 2, after theclothr16 has completed itsrearward travel past needle '12, the thread, 30 which isbeing fed' from the machine in theusualmanner '(not shown) trails the cloth 16 and will continueito be pulled from the machine as the cloth is being withdrawn, unless the thread 30 is cut.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the cloth 16 is moved upwardly behind the attachment and then forwardly over and past the attachment to a position such as that shownrin Fig. 2. In this movement, the. thread 30 is automatically drawn behindand over the attachment as shown in Fig. 2 and as shown in the detailed View ofFig. 5. In this way, the thread 30 passes between successive turns of spring 25 and against knife edge 23, whereby the thread is severed at thatpoint.\nPreferably, the spacing between successive turns of spring 25.;is just sufficient for easy entry of the thread therebetween. However, at alLtirn'es the spring serves, as 1a, guide for the knife. and prevents accidental injury to the operator. Furthermore, in view of the spiral wind ing of thespring, the wire thereof serves cammingly'to guide. the thread between successive turns, so that even if the thread is drawn rearwardly at an angle to the longitudinal direction, it will still spring readily between the successive turns into engagement with the knife edge.\nFig. 5 shows the thread 30 having a portion 30a below the knife cutting edge 23:: and a portion 301) above knife edge 23a. The thread portion 30a leads back to the needle 12 and ultimately to the bobbin,,and the portion- 30b connects with the garment. The thread 30 extends frictionally slidably between successive turns of spring 25. When the thread is severed by knife'edge 23a, the thread portion 30b is drawn upwardly with garment 16. However, the thread portion 30:: is held frictionally between the turns of spring 25 and cannot fall free unless it is pulled clear by the operator. This eliminates any possibility of needle. 12 becoming unthreaded, and also maintainsqthe threadunder the proper tension. As a result, the operator can begin immediately to sew the next garment without any manipulation of the thread.\nIt is importantin the design of this attachment that the tension of the spring be such as to, permit relatively easy entry of the thread between turns of the spring, for the cu tting operation, whileat, the same timeholding the thread portion 30a frictionally between the turns after thev thread has been cut.\nIt will be apparent that-with the use of this attachment, no extra movements or operations on the part of the operator arenecessary to cut the thread after the garment has been sewn, since'the thread is cut automatically when the operator rnoves the garment upwardly and forwardly in the usualmanner, after completion of 1 machine comprising abracket having an arm adapted to e the sewing. operation, ,for withdrawal of the garment,\nfrom the machine. 1 1\nIt will also be apparent, that withthe use of this attachment, no extra movements or operations on the part of the operator are necessaryito manipulate the thread after it has been cut and prior to sewing of the next garment, becausethe thread is held'automatically under tension between the turns of the spring after the thread has been cut.\nWhile.

VOIGHT, OF SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA.\nHAMMER.\nSPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 712,983, dated November 4, 1902.\nApplication filed January 6,1902. Serial No. 88,616. (No model.)\nT0 at whom it may concern:\nBe it known thatwI, GEORGE F. VOIGHT, a citizen of the United States, residing at San Francisco, in the county of San Francisco and State of California,*have invented a new and useful Hammer, of which the following is a specification.\nThe invention relates to improvements in hammers. I\nThe object of the present invention is to improve the construction of hammers and to provide-a simple and comparatively inexpensive tool of great strength and durability having a plurality of claws adapted for extracting large and small fastening devices and capable of enabling a long continuous pull to be effected in extracting large nails and the like.\nThe invention consists in the construction and novel combination and arrangement of parts herein-after fully described, illustrated in the accompanying drawings, and pointed out in the claims hereto appended. y\nIn the drawings, Figure l is a side elevation of a hammer constructed in accordance with this invention. Fig. 2 is a longitudinal sectional View of the same. Fig. 3 is an end view. p\nLike numerals of reference designate corresponding parts in all the figures of the drawings.\n1 designates a hammer-head provided with an elongated eye 2, receiving a handle 3, and the said hammer-head is provided at the outer end of the eye with an outer claw 4, designed for withdrawing the smaller class of fastening devices and provided with a continuouslycurved convex outer face and adapted to form a fulcrum for an inner claw 5, which is designed for extracting large nails and similar fastening devices. The inner claw,which is formed integral with the inner portion of the eye, is extended outward beyond the end of the outer claw in order to enable it to be directly engaged with a nail or other fastening device to permit the same to be extracted without first starting it with the outer claw and then repeating the operation with the inner claw. When the entire extracting operation is performed in this manner by the inner claw, the convex outer face of the outer claw forms a fulcrum for the hammer, and the nail or other fastening device is adapted to be extracted without coming in contact with the outer claw. The opening or space 5 between the sides of the inner elongated claw is of greater width than the opening or space 6 between the sides of the outer claw. The inner faces of the claws are concave, as shown at 7 and 8, and the outer portion of the outer face of the inner claw is convex; but in order to increase the space between the inner face of the outer claw and the inner claw the latter is concavely curved or cut away at 9. This provides ample space for the head of a nail or other fastening device.\nIt will be seen that the hammer is simple and comparatively inexpensive in construetion, that it possesses great strength and durability, and that the inner claw is extended outward beyond the ends of the outer claw to enable it to be directly engaged with a nail or other fastening device for extracting the same. It will also be seen that the outer claw does not interfere with the engagement of the inner claw with a nail having its head located at the surface of a board or the like and that when the inner claw is used for entirely extracting a nail the outer claw will form a fulcrum for the hammer.\nThat I claim is= 1. Ahammer-head provided with inner and outer claws, the inner claw being elongated and extended outward beyond the end of the outer claw to enable it to start a nail or other fastening device, substantially as described.\n2. A hammer-head having an elongated eye and provided at the inner and outer portions thereof with claws, the inner claw being elongated and extended outward from the eye to a point beyond the outer claw to enable it to start a nail, substantially as described.\n3. Ahammer-head having an elongated eye and provided with inner and outer claws having convex outer faces the outer claw being provided with an opening of less width than that of the inner claw, to adapt it to engage small fastening devices, and the'inner claw being elongated and extended outward be yond the end of the outer claw to enable it to start a fastening device, substantially as described.\nGEORGE F. VOIGHT.\nWitnesses:\nCHAS. Scorr, LOUIS KEYEs."

Serial No. 211,100. 2\nT rtZZ whom it may concern.-\nBe it known that we, DANIEL M. RUNDLE and RALPH IV. RUNDLE, citizens of the United States, residing at Harrisburg, Saline county, State of Illinois, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Egg-Cases, of which the following is a specification containing a full, clear, and exact description, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, forming a part hereof.\nOur invention relates to improvements in knockdown shipping-cases, and is designedespecially for egg-cases; and it consists of the novel features herein shown, described, and claimed.\nIn the drawings, Figure 1 is a plan of an egg-case blank ready to be built up. Fig. 2 is a perspective of the egg-case built up with the cover raised. Fig. 3 is a vertical longitudinal section of the egg-case with the cover closed. Fig. 4 is an end elevation of the egg case with the cover open. Fig. 5 is a vertical cross-section of the egg-case. Fig. 6 is a horizontal section through one end of the eggcase upon an enlarged scale and showing the detail of the fastening device. Fig. 7 is an edge view, upon an enlarged scale, of a piece of the material from which the egg-case may be constructed.\nReferring to the drawings in detail, the eggcase blank comprises the rectangular bottom portion 10, the side portions 11 and 12, hinged to or formed integral with the bottom portion, the end portions 13 and 14, hinged to or formed integral with the bottom portion, the end portions 15 and 16, hinged to or formed integral with the side portion 11, the end portions 17 and 18, hinged to or formed integral with the side portion 12, the cover portion 19, hinged to or formed integral with the side portion 11, and the end portions 20 and 21, hinged to or formed integral with the ends of the cover portion 19.- The blank may be formed from a sheet of tough paper or cardboard or strawboard, or it may be formed of cellular material, as shown in Fig. 7, or any similar or suitable material.\nIn setting up the egg-case the end portions 15 and 17 overlap, and the end portions 16 and 18 overlap, then the end portions 13 and 14 are bent upwardly outside of these end portions 15 and 17 and 16 and 18, thus making three thicknesses of the material at each end of the case. The central partition 22 is substantially the same size as the end portions and is inserted between the sides 11 and 12. The partition-fastener is formed of wire and comprises theupper hook 23, the central loop 24, the lower hook 25, the intermediate portion 26, connecting the hook 23 to the loop 24, the intermediate portion 27, connecting the loop 24 to the hook 25, the eye 28, engaging the hook 25, the bar 29, extending through the loop 24, the hooks and 31 upon the ends of the bar 29, and the eyes 32 and 33, engaging the books 30 and 31. The eye 28 is inserted upwardly through the opening 34 at the center of the bottom portion 10. The partition 22 is placed in position. The hook 23 is pressed downwardly upon the upper edge of the partition. The loop 24 is pressed through the opening 35 at the center of the partition. The hook 25 is inserted through the eye 28. The'bar 29 is inserted through the loop 24. The eyes 32 and 33 are inserted inwardly through the openings 36 and 37 in the side portions 11 and 12, and the hooks 30 and 31 are inserted downwardly through the eyes 32 and 33. The intermediate portions 26 and 27 serve as vertical braces for the partition, and the bar 29 serves as a horizontal brace for the partition. The ends of the wires forming the eyes 28, 32, and 33 are bent at right angles to the eyes to form stops and prevent the eyes from being drawn through the material of the egg-case.\nThe end fasteners are formed of wire, and each fastener comprises the central portion 38, the spring- eyes 39 and 40, extending outwardly from the ends of the central portion, and the stops 41 and 42, extendingoutwardly from the eyes 39 and 40. The eyes 39 are inserted through the alined openings 43, 44, and 45, and the eyes are inserted through the alined openings 46, 47, and 48 in the three end portions at each end of the egg-case, thus leaving the cover 19 open. The outer part of the eyes are enlarged to form the shoulders 49 and 50, and spring-wire is used, so that the eyes will snap through the openings, said shoulders serving to hold the eyes in position.\nIVhen it is desired to close the cover, it is pressed downwardly into position and the eyes 39 and 40 are inserted through the openings 51 and 52 in the cover portions 20 and 21. hen desired, the bails 53, having the hooks 5 1 and 55 at their end, may be applied by inserting the hooks 5e and 55 through the eyes 39 and 10. The bails may be used either before the cover is closed or afterward, as desired, said bails being readily removable and replaceable.\nIt is obvious that the details of construction may be varied in many ways without departing from the spirit of our invention. For instance, the cover-section might be disconnected from the remaining part of the blank, and the different portions of the blank might be constructed separately and connected together by strips of cloth or hinged together in any suitable way instead of forming the entire blank out of a single sheet of material.\nWVe claim 1. In a knockdown shipping-case: the bottom portion the side portions 11 and 12 hinged to the bottom portion; the end portions 13 and 14 hinged to the bottom portion; the end portions 15 and 16 hinged to the side portions 11; the end portions 17 and 18 hinged to the side portion 12; the cover portion 19 hinged to one of the side portions; and the end portions 20 and 21 hinged to the cover portion; there being alined openings 43, 14, a5 and 52 in the four end portions; anda second series of alined openings 16, 47, 48 and 51 in the four end portions, in combination with fasteners, each fastener comprising the central portion 38, the spring- eyes 39 and 10 extending outwardly from the ends of the central portion and adapted to be inserted through the alined openings; and the stops 4:1 and r2 extending outwardly from the eyes 39 and substantially as specified.\n2. In a knockdown shipping-case: a blank comprising: a bottom portion; side portions extending both ways from the bottom portion; end portions extending both ways from the bottom portion; end portions extending both ways from both of the side portions; a cover portion extending from one of the side portions; end portions extending from both ends of the cover portion; there being alined openings through all of said end portions, and\neach portion being constructed to bend relative to the other portion, in combination with end fasteners formed of wire and each comprising a straight central portion; spring-eyes extending outwardly from the ends of the central portion and adapted to be inserted through the alined openings; said eyes snapping through said openings; substantially as specified.\n3. In a knockdown shipping-case: a blank comprising: a bottom portion; side portions extending both ways from the bottom portion; end portions extending both ways from the bottom portion; .end portions extending both Ways from both of the side portions; a cover portion extending from one of the side portions; end portions extending from both ends of the cover portion; there being alined openings through all of said end portions, and each portion being constructed to bend relative to the other portion, in combination with end fasteners formed of wire and each comprising a straight central portion; spring-eyes extending outwardly from the ends of the central portion and adapted to be inserted through the alined openings; said eyes snapping through said openings; and bails having hooks at their ends to engage in said eyes; substantially as specified.\n1. In a knockdown shipping-case: the combination with a suitable folding box of a removable partition and a partition-fastener; said fastener comprising an upper hook, a central loop, a lower hook connected together; an eye inserted through the bottom of the box to be engaged by the lower hook, the central loop being inserted through the central part of the partition, and the upper hook being hooked over the upper edge of the partition; a bar extending through the central loop after it is inserted through the partition; hooks upon the ends of the bar; and eyes inserted through the sides of the box to be engaged by said hooks; substantially as specified.\nIn testimony whereof we have signed our names to this specification in presence of two subscribing witnesses.\nDANIEL M. BUNDLE. RALPH l/V. BUNDLE. lNitnesses:\nJ OI-IN L. THOMPSON, JAuus B. Lnwrs."

These members l are hingedly connected by elements 2 which are substantially U-shaped in cross section and are of a length corresponding to the height or length of the members l and are provided at their side edges with knuckles 3, the knuckles on the edges of one element cooperating with thoser on the elements 0n 0pposite sides and being connected thereto by the usual pintles 4. Each of these leaf engaging members l is constructed of the blank shown in Fig. 3 which is semi-circular in shape being provided at its opposite ends 'flush with the straight edge thereof with tongues 5 and 6 which are designed tobe bent to form interlocking hookswhen the blank Vis folded to produce the completed .the lines 7 and 8 whereby two side plates 9 and l0 are Vformed laterally spacedfrom each othei1 a sufficient distance to receive between them on the straight edge thereof one of the connecting hinge elements 2. After being folded on these- lines 7 and 8 with the sideplates 9 andy l0 arranged parallel and spaced Lequal distances apart throughout their length, the hooks which are formed by the tongues 5 and 6 are engaged as shown in Fig. 5 wherebysaid side members or plates9 and 1Q are held securely in position against spreading. rllhese side plates may be secured to the leaf to which they are to be attached by any 'suitable means, apertures ll being preferably provided for rivets which are passed through these plates and the leaf thereby securely connecting them together. In assembling these leaf receiving members la plurality of the elements 2 are first hingedly connected by engaging the pintles 'il with the knuckles of the adjacent elements and then these elements have their folded body portions inserted between the open straight ends of the plates 9 and l0 and when they are so positioned, pintles 12 are extended through registering apertures in the hooks formed by the tongues 5 and 6 and an oppositely disposed aperture in the closed end member which connects the two plates 9 and l0 whereby said plates are firmly secured to the ' hinge members 2 and by this connection said members lr have a slight lateral movement relatively to the hinge elements 2. Any desired number of these leaf engaging members may be so connected according to the number of leaves which are to be united and after the desired number have been so connected, said members l are engaged with the inner corners of the book leaves and secured thereto by rivets or other suitable means, one connected series of members l being engaged with the upper corners of the leaves and another with the lower corners thereof, the closedy ends formed by the portion of the plates between the folds made on the lines 7 and 8 engage the endy edges of the book leaves and `protect them at this point.4 After the leaves have been connected by these members as l section, said U-shaped members being described they may be fastened to the backs hingedly connected at their adjacent edges.\nof a book in any desired manner.\nWhile these hinges have been described as used in connection with the leaves of a book it will be obvious that they may be employed for connecting other articles such as plates or screens or any other objects which are desired to be hingedly connected.\nI claim Yas my invention:\nl.

    "description": "This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 15/937,837, filed Mar. 27, 2018.\nThe invention relates to an illumination device, and especially relates to a clamp lamp capable of clamping a side of a monitor.\nConventional illumination devices are usually immobile and have a relatively large volume, such as drop lights, recessed lights, table lights and so on. For cases in which a user just needs local illumination or intensive illumination to a local area, e.g. illumination only to a screen (e.g. of a monitor of desktop computers, notebook computers and so on), a lamp nearby is used for the required illumination in general. Currently, lamps capable of being fixed on monitors for use are available on the market. For example, when a small USB lamp which includes a flexible tube, a USB connector at one end of the flexible tube, and a light source (e.g. LED) at the other end of the flexible tube is used for illumination, the USB connector is connected to a USB receptacle of a host (e.g. of desktop or notebook computers), and a user can bend the flexible tube such that the light source can be orientated toward a monitor for illuminating the screen of the monitor. At the moment, the whole lamp is supported only by the USB connector. Because the length of the flexible tube is limited, the light source cannot be shifted too far away from the monitor, resulting in that the illumination area by the light source is limited accordingly. For another example, when a lamp with a clip is used, the weight of the whole lamp is supported through the clip. Because the clip is located at an end of the whole lamp, the clip is requested to be capable of offering enough clamping force so that the lamp can be firmly supported. Furthermore, the clip usually uses two opposite surfaces to clamp a frame edge of a monitor. In general, the clamping area by the clip is relatively large, so a portion of the screen of the monitor is probably covered by the clip, resulting in inapplicability of the lamp to monitors with a narrow frame. For another example, when a lamp which is fastened through double-sided tape is used, the weight of the whole lamp is supported through the double-sided tape. Because weight and moment that the double-sided tape can support is limited, the weight and volume of such lamps are relatively small. Accordingly, the light source thereof cannot be shifted too far away from the monitor, and the illumination area by the light source is limited. In addition, for the lamps with a clip that are fixed on the top of a casing of a monitor through the clip for use, when the light source of the lamp is detachable from the clip, the clip may need a mechanism, by which a user can easily install the light source on the clip, and which can clamp the casing firmly without covering the screen of the monitor.\nAn aspect of the invention is to provide a clamp lamp for clamping an outer casing of a monitor. The clamp lamp uses a C-shaped resilient clip for convenience of clamping a light source thereof.\nA clamp lamp for clamping an outer casing of a monitor according to the invention includes a light source, a first clamping part, and a second clamping part. The first clamping part has a first holding portion and a C-shaped resilient clip connected to the first holding portion. The light source is clamped by the C-shaped resilient clip. The second clamping part has a second holding portion. The first holding portion and the second holding portion are movably connected with each other.\nAnother aspect of the invention is to provide a clamp lamp for clamping an outer casing of a monitor. The clamp lamp uses a C-shaped resilient clip for convenience of clamping a light source thereof, and a resilient part for assisting the clamping.\nA clamp lamp for clamping an outer casing of a monitor according to the invention includes a light source, a first clamping part, a resilient part, and a second clamping part. The first clamping part has a first holding portion and a C-shaped resilient clip connected to the first holding portion. The light source is clamped by the C-shaped resilient clip. The light source provides a light in front of a screen of the monitor. The second clamping part has a second holding portion. The first holding portion and the second holding portion are movably connected with each other. Therein, the resilient part is disposed where the first holding portion and the second holding portion are connected, for making the first holding portion and the second holding portion approach each other.\nAnother aspect of the invention is to provide a clamp lamp for clamping an outer casing of a monitor. The clamp lamp uses two clamping parts for clamping the outer casing stably by touching front and rear surfaces of the outer casing simultaneously.\nA clamp lamp for clamping an outer casing of a monitor according to the invention includes a first clamping part and a second clamping part. The outer casing has a front surface, a rear surface, and an upper surface connecting the front surface and the rear surface. The first clamping part has a first holding portion and a light source connected to the first holding portion. The light source provides a light in front of the front surface. The first holding portion includes an abutting portion. The second clamping part has a second holding portion. The first holding portion and the second holding portion are movably connected with each other. The abutting portion is shorter than the second holding portion. Therein, when the clamp lamp clamps the outer casing, the abutting portion touches the front surface, and the second holding portion touches the rear surface.\nThese and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.\nFIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a clamp lamp of an embodiment according to the invention.\nFIG. 2 is a side view of the clamp lamp in FIG. 1 when disposed on a monitor.\nFIG. 3 is an exploded view of the clamp lamp in FIG. 1 .\nFIG. 4 is a schematic diagram illustrating a clamp lamp of another embodiment.\nFIG. 5 is an exploded view of a second holding portion of another embodiment.\nFIG. 6 is a partially exploded view of a clamp lamp of another embodiment.\nFIG. 7 is a schematic diagram illustrating a clamp lamp of another embodiment.\nFIG. 8 is a partially exploded view of the clamp lamp in FIG. 7 .\nPlease refer to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 . A clamp lamp 1 of an embodiment according to the invention includes a light source 10 , a first clamping part 12 , and a second clamping part 14 . The first clamping part 12 has a first holding portion 122 and a lamp connecting portion 124 connected to the first holding portion 122 . The light source 10 is connected to the lamp connecting portion 124 . The second clamping part 14 has a second holding portion 142 and a counterweight 144 (shown in hidden lines the figures) disposed on the second holding portion 142 . The first holding portion 122 and the second holding portion 142 are movably connected with each other. Thereby, when the clamp lamp 1 is disposed on a monitor 2 (for example but not limited to a monitor on a table), the light source 10 can provide illumination (indicated by dashed lines in FIG. 2 ) to a screen of the monitor 2 ; therein, the light source 10 has a socket 102 on a surface 10 a thereof, for receiving an external electric power. The light source 10 receives external electric power through an electrical connection cable 11 (shown in dashed lines in FIG. 1 ) inserted into the socket 102 (e.g. from a notebook computer, a desktop computer, or a device or connection interface capable of providing electric power). In the installation of the clamp lamp 1 , the first holding portion 122 is placed on an outer casing 22 of the monitor 2 . Because the counterweight 144 and the lamp connecting portion 124 are located at two sides of the connection of the first holding portion 122 and the second holding portion 142 relative to a gravity direction (indicated by an arrow in FIG. 2 ), the counterweight 144 makes the first holding portion 122 and the second holding portion 142 approach each other to clamp the outer casing 22 . Therein, in the embodiment, the first holding portion 122 and the second holding portion 142 are pivotally connection. A pivot axis A 1 therefor is indicated by a cross mark in FIG. 2 . Therefore, in the viewpoint of FIG. 2 , the counterweight 144 (or the second clamping part 14 ) produces a clockwise moment relative to the pivot axis A 1 ; the light source 10 (or the light source 10 together with the first clamping part 12 ) produces a counterclockwise moment relative to the pivot axis A 1 . The two moments make the first holding portion 122 and the second holding portion 142 approach each other. Furthermore, the two moments are opposite, which can reduce the torque that the fixing structure of the clamp lamp 1 (including the first holding portion 122 and the second holding portion 142 in the embodiment) sustains. It can be obtained by a static force analysis and will not be described in addition. In other words, when the first clamping part 12 and the second clamping part 14 clamp an object (e.g. an upper side of the outer casing 22 ), the counterweight 144 and the lamp connecting portion 124 are located at two sides of the object (i.e. the outer casing 22 ), which is conducive to reduction of the torque that the fixing structure of the clamp lamp 1 sustains and which also makes an extension line of the gravity center of the clamp lamp 1 pass through or close to an upper surface 22 a of the outer casing 22 such that the clamping force of the first clamping part 12 and the second clamping part 14 to the outer casing 22 can substantially prevent the clamp lamp 1 from moving (including rotating) relative to the outer casing 22 (therein, when the gravity center of the clamp lamp 1 passes through the upper surface 22 a of the outer casing 22 , the clamp lamp 1 will not rotate relative to the outer casing 22 ). In addition, the weight of the counterweight 144 can depend on the weight of the light source 10 and the position of the clamp lamp 1 in use relative to the outer casing 22 . For example, the counterweight 144 and the light source 10 are equal in weight. The light source 10 emits light by using but not limited to light-emitting diodes.\nPlease also refer to FIG. 3 . Furthermore, in the embodiment, the first holding portion 122 has a supporting portion 1222 and an abutting portion 1224 protruding from the supporting portion 1222 . The first holding portion 122 is connected with the second holding portion 142 through the supporting portion 1222 . When the clamp lamp 1 is disposed on the outer casing 22 , the supporting portion 1222 and the abutting portion 1224 contact the upper surface 22 a and the front surface 22 b of the outer casing 22 respectively; therein, the abutting portion 1224 can prevent the second clamping part 14 from dragging the first clamping part 12 rightward due to the counterweight 144 in the viewpoint of FIG. 2 . In practice, the supporting portion 1222 has a slip- proof pad 1222 b on a surface 1222 a thereof that is used to abut against the upper surface 22 a of the outer casing 22 ; the abutting portion 1224 have a slip- proof pad 1224 b (taken as a first slip-proof pad) on a surface 1224 a thereof that is used to abut against the front surface 22 b of the outer casing 22 . The slip- proof pads 1222 b and 1224 b can increase the friction forces between the outer casing 22 and the supporting portion 1222 and the abutting portion 1224 respectively, which is conducive to a stable disposition of the clamp lamp 1 on the outer casing 22 . In practice, the slip- proof pads 1222 b and 1224 b can be but not limited to rubber pads. In addition, the supporting portion 1222 and the abutting portion 1224 without slip- proof pads 1222 b and 1224 b can be formed in a single piece and perpendicular to each other.\nIn the embodiment, the lamp connecting portion 124 includes a C-shaped resilient clip 1242 . The light source 10 is clamped by the C-shaped resilient clip 1242 and provides light projected from an opening 1242 b of the C-shaped resilient clip 1242 . The first holding portion 12 includes a first sliding part 1226 and a second sliding part. The first sliding part 1226 is connected to the C-shaped resilient clip 1242 of the lamp connecting portion 124 . The first sliding part 1226 and the second sliding part are restrictedly slidably connected with each other. In the embodiment, the supporting portion 1222 also serves as the second sliding part, so the second sliding part is connected to the second holding portion 142 ; however, the invention is not limited thereto. In the embodiment, the sliding connection of the first sliding part 1226 with the second sliding part (i.e. the supporting portion 1222 ) is obtained by inserting the first sliding part 1226 into an insertion slot (shown in hidden lines in FIG. 3 ) formed on the supporting portion 1222 ; however, the invention is not limited thereto. In practice, the first sliding part 1226 and the second sliding part (i.e. the supporting portion 1222 ) can be relatively positioned by friction force. The magnitude of the friction force can be determined such that a user is allowed to move the first sliding part 1226 for adjusting the distance between the light source 10 and the screen 29 . When the clamp lamp 1 is in use, the user can move the first sliding part 1226 relative to the second sliding part (i.e. the supporting portion 1222 ) for adjusting the distance between the light source 10 and the first holding portion 122 or the object (i.e. the outer casing 22 ), i.e. the distance between the light source 10 and the screen 20 , as shown by the lamp connecting portion 124 in dashed lines in FIG. 2 . Furthermore, in the embodiment, the light source 10 is rotatably clamped by the C-shaped resilient clip 1242 . Therein, the C-shaped resilient clip 1242 has a limitation slot 1242 a . The socket 102 is slidably disposed in the limitation slot 1242 a . Thereby, by the coordination of the socket 102 with the limitation slot 1242 a , the angular range within which the light source 10 can rotate relative to the C-shaped resilient clip 1242 is limited. From another structural logic, the limitation slot 1242 a and the socket 102 can be regarded as a limitation structure of the clamp lamp 1 , for limiting an angular range of the light source 10 ; therein, the socket 102 is taken as a protrusion on the light source 10 . Therefore, the angular range of the light source 10 relative to the C-shaped resilient clip 1242 is limited by the protrusion (i.e. the socket 102 ) within the limitation slot 1242 . Furthermore, in practice, it is practicable to attach the light source 10 onto the C-shaped resilient clip 1242 in a fixed relative angle. In addition, in practice, the lamp connecting portion 124 and the first holding portion 122 can be formed in a single piece, e.g. by plastic injection molding, as shown by FIG. 4 .\nPlease back to FIG. 1 to FIG. 3 . In the embodiment, the second holding portion 142 has an accommodating room 1422 (shown in dashed lines in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 ). The counterweight 144 is accommodated in the accommodating room 1422 . Therein, the second holding portion 142 includes a first casing 1424 and a second casing 1426 . The first casing 1424 and the second casing 1426 are engaged with each other to form the accommodating room 1422 . In the embodiment, the second holding portion 142 further includes a fastening part 1428 , which fastens the first casing 1424 and the second casing 1426 together so that the counterweight 144 can be disposed in the accommodating room 1422 firmly. Therein, the fastening part 1428 is achieved by two screws, but the invention is not limited thereto. When the clamp lamp 1 is disposed on the outer casing 22 , the second holding portion 142 contacts the outer casing 22 . Similarly, in practice, the second holding portion 142 has a slip- proof pad 1424 b (taken as a second slip-proof pad) on a surface thereof (i.e. a surface 1424 a of the first casing 1424 ) that is used for abutting against the rear surface 22 c of the outer casing 22 , for increasing the friction force between the second holding portion 142 and the outer casing 22 , which is conducive to a stable disposition of the clamp lamp 1 on the outer casing 22 .\nFurthermore, in the embodiment, the first holding portion 122 and the second holding portion 142 are pivotally. Therein, the first holding portion 122 has a first pivotal connection portion 1228 disposed on the supporting portion 1222 . The second holding portion 142 has a second pivotal connection portion 1430 disposed on the second casing 1426 . The first pivotal connection portion 1228 and the second pivotal connection portion 1430 are pivotally connected through a pivot axle 16 (shown in dashed lines in FIG. 2 ). The pivot axle 16 passes through the first pivotal connection portion 1228 and the second pivotal connection portion 1430 . A fixing part 162 is attached onto each end of the pivot axle 16 , such that the first pivotal connection portion 1228 and the second pivotal connection portion 1430 can be constrained between the two fixing parts 162 and stably pivotally connected.\nIn addition, in practice, the first casing 1424 and the second casing 1426 can be engaged with each other by other methods. For example, as shown by FIG. 5 , the first casing 1424 includes a first engagement part 1424 c (achieved by three hooks). The second casing 1426 includes a second engagement part 1426 a (achieved by one lock slot and two protrusive blocks, of which the profiles are shown in hidden lines in FIG. 5 ). The first casing 1424 and the second casing 1426 are joined by engaging the first engagement part 1424 c with the second engagement part 1426 a (i.e. the three hooks hooking the lock slot and the two protrusive blocks respectively). In this case, the fastening part 1428 in FIG. 3 can be skipped; however, in practice, the first casing 1424 and the second casing 1426 can be engaged by the above two joining structures at the same time. Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 5 , the first casing 1424 and the second casing 1426 are also pivotally connected through the pivot axle 16 (shown in dashed lines in the figure). In other words, without the engagement of the first engagement part 1424 c and the second engagement part 1426 a , the first casing 1424 and the second casing 1426 can relatively pivot about the pivot axle 16 . Such structural configuration is convenient for the user to attach or detach the counterweight 144 (shown in dashed lines in the figure). For example, the user can apply force directly to the first casing 1424 and the second casing 1426 so as to separate the first engagement part 1424 c from the second engagement part 1426 a . At the moment, the second holding portion 142 is open, and then, the user can attach or detach the counterweight 144 . Similarly, the user can make the first casing 1424 and the second casing 1426 relatively rotate and close to each other so as to engaging the first engagement part 1424 c with the second engagement part 1426 a.\nPlease refer back to FIG. 1 to FIG. 3 . In the embodiment, when in use, the clamp lamp 1 uses the counterweight 144 to make the first holding portion 122 and the second holding portion 142 approach each other. In practice, the clamp lamp 1 can further include a resilient part 18 (shown in dashed lines in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 ) which is disposed where the first holding portion 122 and the second holding portion 142 are pivotally connected and makes the first holding portion 122 and the second holding portion 142 approach each other. In the embodiment, the resilient part 18 is a torsion spring sleeved on the pivot axle 16 . Two ends of the torsion spring abut against the first holding portion 122 and the second holding portion 142 respectively; however, the invention is not limited thereto. For example, it is practicable to use a tension spring, of which two ends are fixed to the first holding portion 122 and the second holding portion 142 respectively, so as to make the first holding portion 122 and the second holding portion 142 approach each other.\nIn addition, in the embodiment, the disposition angle of the light source 10 can be adjusted through the C-shaped resilient clip 1242 having the limitation slot 1242 a , but the invention is not limited thereto. As shown by FIG. 6 , a clamp lamp 3 of another embodiment is substantially structurally similar to the clamp lamp 1 and uses the reference numbers of the clamp lamp 1 in principle. For other descriptions about the clamp lamp 3 , please refer to the relevant descriptions of the clamp lamp 1 , which will not be described in addition. A difference between the clamp lamp 3 and the clamp lamp 1 is that a first holding portion 322 of a first clamping part 32 of the clamp lamp 3 includes a pivotal connection mount 3226 . A connecting portion 324 of the clamp lamp 3 is pivotally connected with the pivotal connection mount 3226 (e.g. by but not limited to two screws 326 ). A pivot axis A 2 therefor is shown in dashed lines in FIG. 6 . Thereby, a light source 30 of the clamp lamp 3 which is connected to the connecting portion 324 can rotate relative to the pivotal connection mount 3226 through the lamp connecting portion 324 for angular adjustment. In the embodiment, the pivot axis A 2 and the pivot axis A 1 (both shown in dashed lines in FIG. 6 ) are parallel.\nFurthermore, in the clamp lamp 1 , the distance between the counterweight 144 and the pivot axis A 1 (or the pivot axle 16 ) is fixed; however, the invention is not limited thereto. As shown by FIG. 6 , a second holding portion 342 of a second clamping part 34 of the clamp lamp 3 includes a third sliding part 3422 and a fourth sliding part 3424 . The third sliding part 3422 and the fourth sliding part 3424 are restrictedly slidably connected with each other. The counterweight 144 is disposed on the fourth sliding part 3424 . Therein, the third sliding part 3422 and the supporting portion 1222 of the first holding portion 322 are pivotally connected. The third sliding part 3422 has an insertion portion 34222 . The fourth sliding part 3424 has an insertion slot 34242 correspondingly. The insertion portion 34222 is movably inserted into the insertion slot 34242 . In practice, the fixing and adjusting of the insertion portion 34222 and the insertion slot 34242 can be performed by friction force, the coordination of a nut (rotatably disposed on the insertion portion 34222 ) and a leadscrew (fixed on the fourth sliding part 3424 and meshing with the nut), and so on. The second holding portion 342 has an accommodating room 3426 in the fourth sliding part 3424 (or formed by the fourth sliding part 3424 , shown in hidden lines in FIG. 6 ). The counterweight 144 (shown in hidden lines in FIG. 6 ) is accommodated in the accommodating room 3426 . Thereby, by adjusting the relative position of the third sliding part 3422 to the fourth sliding part 3424 , the distance from the counterweight 144 to the pivot axis A 1 (or the pivot axle 16 ), the object (i.e. the outer casing 22 ), or the light source 30 is adjusted.\nIn the above embodiments, the movable connection of the first holding portions 122 and 322 and the second holding portions 142 and 342 is achieved by pivotally connection; however, the invention is not limited thereto. As shown by FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 , a clamp lamp 5 of another embodiment is substantially structurally similar to the clamp lamp 1 and uses the reference numbers of the clamp lamp 1 in principle. For other descriptions about the clamp lamp 5 , please refer to the relevant descriptions of the clamp lamp 1 , which will not be described in addition. In the clamp lamp 5 , a first clamping part 52 and a second clamping part 54 thereof are movably connected with each other by slidable connection. A first holding portion 522 of the first clamping part 52 and a second holding portion 542 of the second clamping part 54 are restrictedly slidably connected with each other. The first holding portion 522 has a supporting portion 5222 and an abutting portion 5224 protruding from the supporting portion 5222 . The first holding portion 522 is restrictedly slidably connected with the second holding portion 542 through the supporting portion 5222 . Therein, the supporting portion 5222 has a sliding slot 5222 a . The second holding portion 542 includes a main body 5422 and a sliding portion 5424 connected to the main body 5422 . The sliding portion 5424 slides in the sliding slot 5222 a . A counterweight 544 is fixed on the main body 5422 (e.g. by but not limited to screwing, adhering and so on). In the embodiment, the clamp lamp 5 includes two guiding posts 56 . The guiding post 56 has a post body 562 and a constraint portion 564 at an end of the post body 562 . The post body 562 passes through a slot hole 5424 a of the sliding portion 5424 and is fixed in the sliding slot 5222 a through the other end thereof. The constraint portion 564 constrains the sliding portion 5424 to slide in the sliding slot 5222 a . Thereby, by adjusting the relative position of the sliding portion 5424 and the sliding slot 5222 a , the distance between the main body 5422 and the abutting portion 5224 can be adjusted for adaptation to the outer casing 22 with different thickness. Furthermore, a change of the relative position of the sliding portion 5424 and the sliding slot 5222 a will change the distance between the counterweight 544 and the light source 10 .\nIn addition, in the embodiment, the clamp lamp 5 can further include a resilient part 58 (shown in dashed lines in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 ) which is connected to the supporting portion 5222 and the second holding portion 542 so as to make the abutting portion 5224 and the second holding portion 542 approach each other. In practice, the resilient part 58 can be a constant-force spring (as shown by FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 ) or a tension spring disposed in the sliding slot 5222 a . One end thereof is connected to the supporting portion 5222 ; the other end thereof is connected to the sliding portion 5424 .\nThose skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device and method may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention. Accordingly, the above disclosure should be construed as limited only by the metes and bounds of the appended claims."

Obviously, the described embodiments are part of but not all of the embodiments of the present disclosure. All other embodiments obtained by any ordinary skilled person in the art based on the embodiments of the present disclosure without making creative work shall fall within the scope of the present disclosure.\nTo be noted that, in the description of the present disclosure, terms of “center”, “up”, “down”, “left”, “right”, “vertical”, “horizontal”, “inner”, “outer”, and so on, are used to indicate an orientation or a position as shown in the attached drawings. The terms are used only for the purpose of facilitating and simplifying description of the present disclosure, but not to indicate or imply that a device or an element referred to must have a particular orientation, or must be constructed and operate in a particular orientation. Therefore, the terms shall not be interpreted as limiting the present disclosure. Furthermore, terms “first”, “second” and “third” are used for descriptive purposes only and shall not be interpreted as indicating or implying relative importance.\nAs shown in FIGS. 1 to 4 , the present disclosure provides a foldable chair 1 including a base 10 , four extendable-and- retractable arms 11 connected to the base 10 , and four legs 12 connected to the base 10 . The base 10 includes a support 13 defining an inner cavity 100 and a locking assembly 14 received in the inner cavity 100 . The support 13 includes an upper receiving portion 131 connected to the arms 11 and a lower receiving portion 132 connected to the legs 12 . An end of each leg 12 connected to the lower receiving portion 132 is arranged with leg teeth 121 . Leg teeth 121 of the plurality of legs 12 are engaged with each other, such that motion of one of the plurality of legs 12 may drive the rest of the plurality of legs 12 to move.\nIn detail, the locking assembly 14 includes a leg unlocking button 141 inserted in the inner cavity 100 and slidable with respect to the support 13 , a first spring 142 sleeving the leg unlocking button 141 , and a first locking block 143 connected to the leg unlocking button 141 . The end of each leg 12 connected to the lower receiving portion 132 defines a leg positioning slot 120 . When the legs 12 are extended with respect to the base 10 to provide a support for the base 10 , the first locking block 143 is snapped in the leg positioning slot 120 and positions the legs by a spring force provided by the first spring 142 .\nIn some embodiments, the end of each leg 12 connected to the lower receiving portion 132 is arranged with a leg arc portion 122 . The leg teeth 121 are distributed on both sides of the leg arc portion 122 . Each tooth of the leg teeth 121 is elliptically chamfered.\nIn the present embodiment, the upper receiving portion 131 is arranged with a stopper portion 136 to limit a downward rotation angle of each arm 11 . When the arms 11 are unfolded, the arms 11 may be limited by the stopper portion 136 and may not further fold downwardly, such that the foldable chair may stand stably. The locking assembly 14 further includes an arm unlocking button 144 inserted in the inner cavity 100 and slidable relative to the support 13 , a second spring 145 sleeving the arm unlocking button 144 , and a second locking block 146 connected to the arm unlocking button 144 . An end of each arm 11 connected to the upper receiving portion 131 defines an arm positioning slot 110 . When the arms 11 are unfolded relative to the base 10 , the second locking block 146 is snapped in the arm positioning slot 110 and positions the arms 11 by a spring force provided by the second spring 145 .\nWhen the foldable chair 1 needs to be folded, the leg unlocking button 141 may be pressed to allow the plurality of legs 12 to move into a retracted state at the same time. In detail, the plurality of legs 12 rotate upwards at the same time by taking the lower receiving portion 132 as a rotating center. Pressing the arm unlocking button 144 may allow the plurality of arms 11 to move to a retracted state at the same time. In detail, the plurality of arms 11 rotate upwards at the same time by taking the upper receiving portion 131 as a rotating center. Rotation may be completed when the plurality of arms 11 are approximately parallel to the plurality of legs 12 . In this way, the arms 11 and the legs 12 may be transitioned between the expanded state and the retracted state, folding and unfolding operations may be performed easily.\nIn some embodiments, each leg 12 defines a receiving slot 125 . When the foldable chair is folded, each arm 11 is stored in one corresponding leg 12 , such that a size of the foldable chair is reduced.\nAs shown in FIGS. 5 to 7 , in another embodiment, the upper receiving portion 131 is arranged with a stopper portion 133 configured to limit an upward rotation angle of each arm 11 . Each arm 11 includes a front arm 113 and a rear arm 114 . A maximum length of the front arm 113 is less than a maximum length of the rear arm 114 . The stopper portion 133 includes a front stopper portion 1331 and a rear stopper portion 1332 . An angle at which the front arm 113 is limited by the front stopper portion 1331 to rotate is less than an angle at which the rear arm 114 is limited by the rear stopper portion 1332 to rotate. Due to the stopper portion 133 , the angle at which each arm 11 can rotate upwards is limited. When the plurality of extendable-and- retractable arms 11 are extended, a tension provided by a seat fabric 3 , which is connected to the arms 11 , may be taken to prevent the arms 11 from moving downwards. When the foldable chair 1 needs to be folded, the leg unlocking button 141 may be pressed to allow the plurality of legs 12 to rotate downwards at the same time by taking the lower receiving portion 132 as the rotating center, and at the same time, the plurality of arms 11 are retracted and drop downwards naturally, such that the foldable chair is folded.\nAs shown in FIG. 8 and FIG. 9 , the present disclosure further provides a foldable chair 2 including a first base 21 , a second base 22 spaced apart from the first base 21 , a crossbar 20 connecting the first base 21 and the second base 22 , a plurality of first support members 23 connected to a side of the first base 21 away from the crossbar 20 , and a plurality of second support members 24 connected to a side of the second base 22 away from the crossbar 20 . The first base 21 includes a first support defining a first inner cavity 210 and a first locking assembly 212 received in the first inner cavity 210 . The second base 22 includes a second support 221 defining a second inner cavity 220 and a second locking assembly (now shown in the drawings) received in the second inner cavity 210 . An end of each first support member 23 connected to the first base 21 is arranged with first teeth 231 . First teeth 231 of the plurality of first support members 23 are engaged with each other, such that motion of one of the plurality of first support members 23 may drive the rest of the plurality of first support members 23 to move. An end of each second support member 24 connected to the second base 22 is arranged with second teeth 241 . Second teeth 241 of the plurality of second support members 24 are engaged with each other, such that motion of one of the plurality of second support members 24 may drive the rest of the plurality of second support members 24 to move.\nThe plurality of first support members 23 include two first legs 232 and two extendable-and-retractable first arms 233 . The plurality of second support members 24 include two second legs 242 and two extendable-and-retractable second arms 243 . It shall be understood that the legs are configured to be disposed on a supporting surface such as the ground to allow the foldable chair to stand stably. The arms are configured to support the seat fabric to form a seat to allow a person to sit on. The arm having a large length may serve as a support for a backrest part of the chair. In order to make the user comfortable when sitting on the chair, an angle formed between the four first support members 23 is not 90° in a plane perpendicular to the crossbar 20 , and an angle formed between the four second support members 24 is not 90° in the plane perpendicular to the crossbar 20 . Therefore, in the present embodiment, the first base 21 further includes a first auxiliary gear 215 disposed between the first teeth 231 of one of the plurality of first support members 23 and the first teeth 231 of another one of the plurality of first support members 23 . The auxiliary gear may be engaged with the teeth of the plurality of first support members 23 to ensure that the teeth of the plurality of first support members 23 may move synergistically. The second base 22 is in mirroring to the first base 21 .\nAccording to the present disclosure, the foldable chair includes the base, a plurality of extendable-and-retractable arms connected to the base, and a plurality of legs connected to the base. The base includes a support defining the inner cavity and the locking assembly received in the inner cavity. The support includes the upper receiving portion connected to the arms and the lower receiving portion connected to the legs. The end of each leg connected to the lower receiving portion is arranged with leg teeth. The leg teeth of the plurality of legs are engaged with each other, such that such that motion of one of the plurality of legs may drive the rest of the plurality of legs to move.

OUELLETT'E CONTAINER Jan. 18, 1938.\nFiled Sept. 18, 1936 2 Sheets-Sheet 2 I N TOR ALPHOHSE ousums BY Z flfirmw EXT T0 RNEY Patented Jan. 18, 1938 UNITED ST'lES CONTAINER Application September 18, 1936, Serial No. 101,485 In Canada August 22, 1936 1 Claim.\nThis invention relates to containers made by creasing and folding a single blank of cardboard or similar flexible material and particularly to containers of this type which are adapted to be expanded to form a display tray or basket for displaying food products and other merchandise.\nMore particularly, the present invention consists in the provision of a container constructed so that it may be readily converted from a substantially square box-like structure into an octagonal display basket or tray of increased capacity which is useful for displaying fruits, vegetables, and other merchandise.\nProceeding now to a more detailed description reference will be had to the accompanying drawings, wherein- Fig. l is a plan view of the blank from which my improved container is constructed.\nFig. 2 is a view similar to Fig. l, but showing the blank partly folded.\nFig. 3 is a perspective view of the container produced by appropriate folding of the blank shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In this view one of the auxiliary side wall sections of the container is shown in raised position to disclose parts that would otherwise be hidden from view.\nFig. 4 is a perspective view of the container in partly erected condition.\nFig. 5 is a perspective view showing the complete container as it appears prior to being expanded to form a display tray or basket.\nFig. 6 is a perspective view of the container as it appears in its expanded condition.\nFig. 7 is av sectional view taken substantially along the line 'll of Fig. 6.\nThe blank from which my improved display container is made is shown to advantage in Figs. 1 and 2. This blank is creased to define a square bottom wall II having its sides integrally joined to four main side wall sections designated l2 and Ill. The sections l2 are hingedly connected to diametrically opposite sides of the bottom wall along suitable crease lines Ila. while the sections I3 are similarly connected to the remaining sides of the bottom wall along the crease lines Ho. The main side wall sections l2 are provided with auxiliary side wall sections l2a. J'oined thereto along the crease lines lZb. These auxiliary side wall sections lZa. are foldable on the crease lines IN) to overlie the inner sides of the main sections l2 and are provided with extensions I20 adapted to be engaged in slots IZd provided in the bottom wall ll adjacent the crease lines I la. The auxiliary side wall sections IM are of the same length and width as the main sections l2 to which they are attached.\nThe main side wall sections I3 are also provided with auxiliary side wall sections I3d joined thereto along the crease lines I312. The auxiliary side wall sections I3a. are foldable on the crease lines l3b to lie against the inner sides of the main sections l3, it being noted that the auxiliary sections l3a. are narrower than the main sections l3 but of substantially the same length.\nEach main side wall section It is also provided with integral terminal extensions I4 Which are free of attachment to the main side wall sections l2. Each extension M is a trapezium figure presenting four angularly related sides designated Ma, Mb, Me and Md. The side Md is hingedly connected to one end of section l3 and lies at right angles to the side Mb which is of equal length. The side Mb is a continuation of that longitudinal edge of section l3 which is hinged to the bottom wall ll along the crease line Ill). The side Mb thus constitutes the lower edge of the extension M and is adapted to rest on the bottom wall II when said extension occupies the position shown in Fig. 3. The two remaining sides Me and Md of each extension M are of equal length with respect to each other but somewhat shorter than the sides Ma and lib. These sides Mo and Md are inclined so that, when the wall section I3 is in an upright position, the side Mc slopes downwardly from the horizontal plane containing the upper edge of said section l3 while the side Md slopes downwardly at a somewhat sharper angle from the lower end of the side Me to the corner where the side Md joins the side Mb. It will also be noted that each extension M- is divided by a diagonal crease line I5 into, a pair of fold-ably related triangular sections l6 and ii. The crease line l5 extends across the extension M from the juncture of the sides Ma and Mb to the juncture of the remaining sides Mo and Md.\nEach auxiliary side wall section I3d is also provided with terminal extensions ll! of trapezium form defined by the four angularly related side walls lBa, I82), I80 and lBd. The side I819 is a continuation of the free longitudinal edge I30 of the wall section l3a. and forms the lower edge of the extension l3 when the wall sections l3 and I301. are disposed in an upright position with the wall section l3 (see Fig. 4). The side Ida of each extension I8 lies at right angles to the side I81) and is integrally joined to one end of the wall section l3a. The side l8c of each extension I8 is inclined so that it coincides with the side Me of one of the extensions I4 when the auxiliary wall section I30. is folded to lie against the main section I3. This is shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 6. The remaining side I811 of each section I8 is inclined so that, with the parts arranged as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, it is projected beyond the side I402 of the adjacent extension M. It will also be noted that each extension I 8 is divided by a diagonal crease line I9 into two foldably related sections and 2| of substantially triangular form. When the auxiliary side wall sections Ita are folded to lie against the inner sides of the main sections I3 the crease lines of the extensions I9 coincide with the crease lines I5 of the extensions I4.\nIn setting up my improved container the auxiliary side wall sections I3 are first folded on the crease lines I3b to lie against the inner sides of the main side wall sections I3. The extensions I8 of the auxiliary wall sections I 3 are thus super posed on the extensions M of the wall sections I3 as shown to advantage in Fig. 2. In this position of the connected wall sections I3 and I3a the crease lines I9 of the extensions I8 are disposed to coincide with the crease lines I5 of the extensions I I. The wall sections I3 are next bent along the crease lines III) to the upright position shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The several extensions I4 and I8 are then bent inwardly as shown more particularly in Fig. 4 to lie against the inner surfaces of the side walls I2 which are bent upwardly along the crease lines I la. The auxiliary side wall sections In are then folded down Wardly on the crease lines I2b to overlie the adjacent folded extensions I4 and I8 of the side wall sections I3 and I3a. The side wall sections IZa are secured in their downwardly folded position by inserting the tongues I20 in the slots I2d formed in the bottom wall II. This method of folding the blank results in the production of a square box of the type shown in Fig. 5 but one in which the side wall sections I3 are capable of being swung from the position shown in Fig. 5 to that shown in Figs. 6 and 7. In the latter position the extensions I4 and I8 at each corner of the container are partially withdrawn from between the adjacent wall sections I2 and I2a to increase the capacity of the container by changing the side wall structure from a square to an octagonal structure. In this connection it will be noted that, with the parts positioned as shown in Fig. 3, there is sufficient clearance above the sloping sides I40 and I80 of the extensions I4 and I8 to permit the triangular sections I6 and Zii of these extensions to move outwardly with the side wall sections I3 and I 3a from the position shown in Fig. 3 to that shown in Figs. 6 and 7. It will also be noted that this withdrawal of the corner flap sections I6 and 20 from between the adjacent wall sections I2 and I2a results in the sloping edges I8d of the flap sections I8 being brought into engagement with the folded material joining the upper edges of said sections I2 and I2a. so that these edges I8d serve as stops which limit the outward movement of the side Wall sections I3 with respect to the ends of the side wall sections I2.\nHaving thus described my invention what I claim is:\nA container of the character described comprising a square bottom wall, side walls extending upwardly from two of the opposite edges of the bottom wall, each of said side walls comprising an outer wall section having its lower edge hinged to the bottom wall and an inner wall section having its upper edge hinged to the outer Wall section and its lower edge releasably secured to said bottom wall and two additional side walls hingedly connected to the remaining sides of the bottom wall, each of said additional side walls comprising inner and outer sections provided with integral terminal extensions hingedly connected thereto, said terminal extensions being slidably fitted between the inner and outer wall sections of the first-mentioned side walls and being creased so that portions thereof are capable of assuming an angular position with respect to the first-mentioned side walls when partly withdrawn therefrom.\nALPHONSE OUELLETTE."

Buttery, Kalamazoo, Mich., assignor to Sutherland Paper Company, Kalamazoo, Mich., a corporation of Michigan Application July 12, 1946, Serial No. 683,029 I The main objects of this invention are:\nFirst, to provide a collapsible box or carton I which may be formed of a single blank and one in which the parts are associated so that the box may be quickly set up or erected and one in which the parts are very effectively retained in position when the box is erected.\nSecond, to provide a box or carton of this character which is well adapted for the display of merchandise-for example, fruit and various bakery products.\nThird, to provide a structure having these advantages which may be very economically pro duced from comparatively light stock and at the same time is quite rigid when set-up.\nObjects relating to details and.economies of the invention will appear from the description to follow. The invention is defined and pointed out in the claims.\nA preferred embodiment of the invention is 6 Claims. (01129-30) illustrated in the accompanying drawing, in\nwhich:\nFig. 1 is a perspective View of a carton embodying the features of the invention fully set up.\nFig. 2 is a bottom perspective view of the collapsed carton.\nFig. 3 is a top perspective view of the collapsed carton.\nFig. 4 is an enlarged fragmentary perspective view of the erected carton.\nFig. 5 is a fragmentary perspective view illustrating certain stages of the erection of the carton by the preferred method.\nFig. 6 is a fragmentary perspective view illustrating the succeeding stage in the erection of the carton.\nFig. 7 is a plan view of the blank.\nThe embodiment of the invention illustrated is formed of a single blank and comprises a bottom designated generally by the numeral I and made up of bottom members or sections 2 and 3. These members or sections 2 and 3 are disposed at the ends of the blank. The blank is folded and separated from their inner edges by slits 8. The ends of the end walls and the ends of the side walls are connected by corner members ll hingedly secured to the end walls at II and to the side walls at l2. These corner members are diagonally scored at l3 to permit. folding of the corner-members on the inner sides of the end walls as is shown inFigs. 1 and 4.\nThe end walls are provided with tucking flap extensions l4 hingedly connected thereto at 15 desirably by a series of spaced slits. These tucking flaps are adapted to be tucked between the folded corner members and the bottom.\nThe tucking flaps are provided with slits Is at the ends of their hinge connections to the end walls, these slits being engageable with lugs I! provided therefor to coact therewith, these lugs being formed on the bottom edges of the corner members or the comer members being formed to. provide these lugs.\nThe end'walls desirably extend substantially above the side walls and are provided, in the preferred embodiment, with wrapper supporting flaps or extensions l8 connected thereto by the weakened or hinge lines l9. It will be observed that the extra height of the end walls and their wrapper supporting flaps are formed from stock in the blank between the side walls.\nWith the blank cut and scored as illustrated and folded to bring the bottom members into overlapping relation, the bottom members being secured in this relation, .a tubular structure is provided such as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.\nTo erect the carton, pressure is applied to the opposite edges of the folded carton, as shown in Fig. 2, preferably with the carton in inverted position. The end walls may be simultaneously swung to erected position and the locking flaps l4 inserted by grasping as indicated in Fig. 5, thrusting inwardly upon the end walls, desirably both ends simultaneously, and when the flaps II are completely inserted the lugs 11 snap into slits or slots l6 locking the box in'erected position. This same movement will turn the wrapper supporting flap inwardly. The carton may then be turned to upright position and filled. Commonly, a transparent wrapper is wrapped around the filled carton, the inturned wrapper supporting flaps serving to eifectively support the ends of the wrapper during wrapping and facilitating the wrapping.\nMy improved carton is economical to produce and may be folded to the tubular form shown in Figs. 5 and 6 by types of folding and gluing machines now in extensive use.\nThe structure is economical in material and even when formed of comparatively light stock is quite strong and rigid It is not likely'to accidentally collapse.\nI have illustrated and described the invention in a. tray type of container such as is extensively used in the packaging of tomatoes and certain other fruits and vegetables and bakery products. It should be understood, however, that it is capable ofa very wide range of adaptations in the matter of size and proportions and these depending quite largely on particular uses.\nIt is believed that this disclosure will enable those skilled in the art to embody or adapt the invention as may be desired and therefore these contemplated adaptations are not illustrated or described.\nHaving thus described my invention, what I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is:\n1. A collapsible box formed of a single blank scored and slit to provide hingedly connected bottom and side and end walls, the bottom comprising complementary bottom members disposed at the ends of the blank and overlapped and adhesively secured together, the side walls bein hingedly connected in the blank to the inner edges of the bottom members, the end walls being disposed in the blank between the inner edges of the side walls, said side walls and end walls being connected only by foldable corner members, said corner members being foldable upon the inner sides of the end walls, the end walls being of greater width than the side walls and having tucking flaps at their outer edges in the blank, the tucking flaps being disposed between the bottom and the lower edges of the comer members when the box is erected, there being slits at the ends of their hinge connections to the end walls, the corner members having lugs engaging said slits when the end walls are erected, the end walls being provided with wrappin supporting flaps on their inner edges in the blank, the portions of the end walls which extend above the upper edges of the side walls and the said wrapping supporting flaps being formed of stock between the inner edges of the side walls in the blank.\n2.

(Cl. 229-36) This invention relates to combined shipping and dis-.\nnited States Patent play boxes adapted for-useinthe shipping and/or storage of merchandise and for attractively displaying the merchandise.\nThe present invention contemplates the provision of a substantially rectangular box having its side and end walls disposed in planes normal to its bottom when employed in the transportation'of merchandise and movable to inclined planes 'to form a display basket for 'the'merchandise.\nThe invention further contemplates the provision \"of a combined shipping and display box adapted to be inexpensively formed from sheet material, such as paperboard, cut and scored to provide hingedly interconnected sections foldable relative to each other to form the cover, bottom, side and end walls of the box, the cover being hinged to the upper edge of one side wall and provided with fastening means for detachable engagement with the other side wall to maintain the side walls in upright parallel planes normal to the bottom of the box.\nThe invention further contemplates the provision of a combined shipping and display box in which end sections are hingedly connected to opposite ends of the bottom, each end section being foldable upon itself to form inner and outer end walls defining a pocket therebetween to receive gussets hinged to opposite ends of the side walls, the free ends of the end sections extending flush along the bottom and being secured to each other.\nThe invention further contemplates the provision of a box structure in which the gussets and walls form an eight-sided basket display when the walls are pivoted away from each other, the outward movement of the walls being limited by engagement of the gussets with their related end walls.\nThe invention further contemplates a box structure having a cover foldable upon itself for display purposes and secured in folded position by engagement at its ends with adjacent gussets.\nThis invention embodies other novel features, details of construction and arrangement of parts which are hereinafter set forth in the specification and claim and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein:\nFig. 1 is a perspective view illustrating a combined shipping and display box embodying features of the invention, the box being shown in its closed position to house merchandise for shipping and/or storage.\nFig. 2 is a perspective view illustrating the box in its opened display position.\nFig. 3 is a longitudinal sectional view taken along the line 3-3 of Fig. 1.\nFig. 4 is a transverse sectional view taken along the line 44 of Fig. 1.\nFig. 5 is a top plan view of the box, showing the cover in opened position.\nFig. 6 is a top plan view showing the box in its opened display position.\nFig. 7 is a plan view illustrating the manner in which 2,793,8012 Patented May 28, 1 957 a blank of sheet material is cut and scored to form the box. I\nReferring now to the drawings'for a better understanding of the invention, a combined shipping and display box is shown as comprising a blank 2 of sheet material, such as paperboard, scored longitudinally along parallel lines 33 and transversely along parallel lines 44 to form a bottom 6, side walls 7 and '7a hingedly connected to the'bottom 6, , end sections 8 and 8a hingedly connected to opposite ends of he bottom -6, and gussets 9 hingedly connected to opposite ends of the side walls 7 and 7a.\nEach end section 8 is scored transversely at 1'1 and '12 to form hingedly connected outer and inner end walls 13 and 14, respectively, and an end portion 16 hinged to its respective inner end wall 14. The outer end of the end. section 8 is formed with a tongue 17 for engagement withina recess 18 formed in the outer end of the end section 8a.\nA cover 19 .is hingedly connected along a score line 21 to the side wall 7 and is provided with side flaps 22--22 and an end flap 23 ,hingedly connected thereto along score lines 24-24 and '26, respectively. To permit the cover to be folded upon itself, the cover and end flaps22-22 are scored along the line .25. The end flaps 2222 are formedwith notches 2 7\"27 along the score lines 24-24 to receive adjacent gussets 99 when the box is in its opened display position with the cover 19 folded upon itself. The end flap 23 is cut along the line 28 to form a double- ear tab 29 for interlocking engagement within bracket-shaped slits 31-31 formed in the side wall 7a.\nEach gusset 9 is scored diagonally along the line 32 to form hingedly connected inner and outer gusset sections 33 and 34, respectively.\nTo construct a box from the blank illustrated in Fig. 7, the side walls 7 and 7a are folded upwardly and inwardly into parallel relationship above the bottom 6, and their respective gussets 9 are folded inwardly toward each other to form a generally rectangular enclosure. The end sections 8 and 8a are then folded upwardly against the outer sides of their adjacent gussets 9 and are then folded along their score lines 11 downwardly to dispose the outer and inner end walls 13 and 14 on opposite sides of their adjacent gussets 9, with their end portions 16 flush against the upper surface of the bottom 6. The gussets 9 are thus enclosed within pockets defined between related inner and outer end walls. To lock the end sections 8 and 8a to each other, the tongue 17 is engaged within the recess 18, the end portions 16 being securely held against the upper surface of the box bottom 6 by merchandise positioned within the box for shipment or display purposes.\nAfter the box has been filled with merchandise for transportation purposes, the cover 19 is folded downwardly and the ears on the locking tab 29 are engaged within the bracket-shaped slits 31-31 formed in the side wall 7a.\nAfter a box containing the merchandise has arrived at its destination for display of the merchandise to the public, the cover 19 is detached from the side wall 7a. The side and end walls are then folded outwardly away from each other to form an eight-sided display basket, as illustrated in Fig. 2, and the cover 19 is then folded inwardly and downwardly upon itself until the gussets on the side wall 7 are engaged within the notches 2727 formed in the end flaps 2222. Outward pivotal movement of the side and end walls is limited by engagement of the upper diagonally disposed edges 36 of the gussets 9 against the junctures of related outer and inner end walls 13 and 14.\nIt will be noted that a box made in accordance with the invention provides an inexpensive, sturdy container for the transportation of merchandise, and'provides an attractive eight-sided, basket-type display for the merchandise shipped therein.\nWhile this invention has been shown in but one form, it is obvious to those skilled inthe art that it is not \"so limited, but is susceptible of various changes and modifications Without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed invention.\nI claim as my invention:\nA combined shipping and display container formed of a unitary paperboard blank cut,.scored :and folded to define a substantially rectangular box when closed and distendable when open to an eight-sided display basket,\nengagement therein responsive to pivotal movement of said side and end walls, said gussets including inclined upper edge portions for abutting engagement with the fold of said end walls to limit the outward pivotal movement of the side and end walls to form said eight-sided basket, each gusset being scored diagonally intermediate its hinged and opposed free edge providing hingedly con- 'nected inner and outer flat portions, said diagonal score lines being disposed in alignment with adjacent side edges of the end Walls when said side and end Walls are pivoted outwardly, a cover hinged to one of said side Walls including a terminal flap adapted to lie against the opposed side Wall, and means formed on said flap engageable with complementary means formed, on the latter side wall for securing the assembly in said rectangular box form, said cover being foldable on itself and including notched lateral extensions for receiving adjacent gussets when the assembly is distended to said eight-sided display basket form.\nReferences Cited in the file of this patent UNITED STATES PATENTS 1,520,135 Myers Dec. 23, 1924 1,765,964 Berton June 24, 1930 1,826,962 Spare Oct. 13, 1931 2,105,953 Ouellette Ian. 18, 1938 2,113,349 Keener Apr. 5, 1938 2,148,533 Chapman Feb. 28, 1939 2,189,602 Denny Feb. 6, 1940 2,326,390 Platt Aug. 10, 1943 2,375,843 Gottlieb May 15, 1945 2,505,034 Fettinger Apr. 25, 1950 2,663,487 Paige Dec. 22, 1953 McReary Ian. 26, 1954"

MELLO SANITARY WATER-CLOSET BOWL Filed June 20, 1955 FIGS  2,853,?13 Patented Sept. 30, 1958 ice SANITARY WATER-CLOSET BOWL Romualdo da Silva Mello, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil I Application June 20, 1955, Serial No. 516,720\n3 Claims. (Cl. 469) The present invention relates to sanitary bowls. Conventional sanitary or toilet bowls, although in same becomes very difficult and requires the use of mechanical means such as a brush. In the novel bowl such a drawback is avoided because fecal matter projected upon the steeply inclined wall 1 will rapidly slide therefrom and because flushing takes place in the direction of fall of the fecal matter. It is possible for the user to place a sheet of tissue paper over the sloping part of the bowl, at the point of incidence of the fecal matter whereby the latter is tobogganed downward by flushing.\ncommon use in the more developed countries, are subject to various deficiencies as regards the receiving and disposal of waste materials.\nIt is an object of the invention to overcome these deficiencies which will hereinafter be described in greater detail.\nIn the drawing in which conventional bowls are compared with the improvements provided by the invention:\nFigs. 1 and 2 illustrate, in longitudinal section, two conventional types of bowls;\nFigs. 3 and 4, respectively, are top and sectional views of a further conventional bowl;\nFig. 5 is a top view of a-bowl provided in accordance with the invention; and\nFig. 6 is a longitudinal section of the bowl of Fig. 5.\nWith regard to the conventional bowls shown in Figs. 1 and 2, there exists the possibility of the splashing of contaminated water when fecal matter is discharged into the same. This is not hygienic and exposes the user to germs and dirt.\nThe dished bottom bowl shown in Figs. 3 and 4 is similarly deficient as regards the splashing of water and, moreover, provides a ledge for the accumulation of fecal matter whereby deposits may reach the body of the user. Further, this type of bowl is readily dirtied and requires constant cleaning.\nIn accordance with the invention, there is provided, instead of a conventional dished bottom which is horizontal and has a large surface, a substantially different bowl as illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6.. Said bowl has certain similarities to the ordinary dish bottomed bowl and to the conventional bowl, but differs structurally and functionally from both.\nThe bowl of the invention has a comparatively steep slope along a fairly long expanse 1, from back to front, so that the water surface or trap is restricted to the front part 2 of the device and thus is spaced from the point of fall of fecal matter. Said fecal matter will thus fall against the surface of bowl 1 which has a steep slope and becomes horizontal at terminal part or ledge 3, before reaching water trap 2. Fecal matter dropped onto thissteep slope 1 slides rapidly along same and comes to rest on the terminal part 3 which preferably has a surface above the normal water level in the bowl and which constitutes in fact a receptacle wherefrom it is finally removed by the water discharge. A discharge conduit 4 is connected in siphon-like arrangement to trap 2 and includes an apex 5 determining the normal water level in the trap.\nIn this way fecal matter may be easily inspected and, since it does not fall directly on the water, it will not give rise to splashing water onto the user. Said receptacle 3, not directly beneath falling fecal matter, contains no more than a minimum quantity of water such as a few millimeters, which is only enough to prevent fecal matter from adhering to the lower bowl wall. Sometimes fecal matter adheres so well that removal of the This is, in fact, one of the advantages of the new bowl since the dish-bottomed bowl and the conventional bowl have walls which are almost vertical with a large water surface so that a greater sprinkling action results.\nAs has been said above, the flushing with water is carried out in the same direction as the fecal matter is to be carried away and thus completely washes the bowl. This also prevents said matter from depositing in the water adjacent the syphon, which water is in very small quantity. Thus both the water and the fecal matter can readily reach the second part of the syphon.\nThe novel bowl is also based on the hydraulic syphon principle, although with recourse to modified action to prevent complete emptying of the bowl, since the water is intended to isolate the discharge conduit from the outer atmosphere.\nThe novel bowl may furthermore be used in place of any existing conventional bowl and substitution is very easy because the dimensions and base arrangement may be the same as in conventional bowls.\nThere will now be obvious to those skilled in the art many variations of the structure set forth, these variations lying within the scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1. A water closet bowl comprising an outside Wall defining an oval shaped cavity having a front and rear, a discharge portion connected to the cavity and including an apex defining a normal water level in the cavity, a first wall portion extending into the cavity and supported by the rear portion of the outside wall, said first wall portion being inclined from the horizontal, a substantially horizontal wall portion extendingin front of the center of the bowl, and a second wall portion intermediate said first and horizontal wall portions and integral therewith and supporting said horizontal wall portion substantially at the level of the apex of the discharge portion, said second wall portion being inclined more from the horizontal than said first wall portion.\n2. A toilet bowl comprising an outside wall defining an oval shaped cavity having a front and rear, a discharge portion connected to the cavity and including an apex defining a normal water level in the cavity, an inclined wall portion extending into the cavity and supported at its upper end by the rear portion of the outside wall for directly receiving falling fecal matter, a substantially horizontal wall portion supported on and extending from the lower portion of the inclined wall and terminating in front of the center of the bowl, said horizontal wall portion having an upper surface substantially at the level of the apex of the discharge portion.\n3. A bowl as claimed in claim 2, wherein the horizontal wall portion includes a front edge having a down: wardly projecting lip extending below the level of the apex of the discharge portion.\nReferences Cited in the file of this patent UNITED STATES PATENTS 167,032 Stanton et al.

B (1511 INVENTOR.\nUnited States Patent Ofiice 2,953,176\nPatented Sept. 20, 1960 FEEDING SPOON Leon D. Bush, 4250 W. Diversey Ave, Chicago, Ill.\nFiled July 29, 1958, Ser. No. 751,686\n1 Claim. (Cl. 141-18) This invention relates to a spoon feeding device and more particularly to a device of this type having novel means for attaching a hollow stemmed spoon to a squeezeable container alternatively in either an inside or outside position.\nSpoon feeding devices generally comprise a bottle or container for holding viscous ingredients such as baby food. These containers are made of a resilient material, such as plastic, to enable squeezing and have an opening at one end. A spoon having a hollow stem is also provided. The hollow stem has one open end in communication with the bowl of the spoon. Another open end is situated over the bottle opening so as to be in communication therewith. Further means is usually provided to attach the spoon to the bottle.\nTo operate the-device the container is held tilted above the spoon and the ingredients flow into the spoon by gravity. If the ingredients viscosity is such that it does not flow through the hollow stem naturally, merely squeezing the bottle initiates the flow.\nGenerally, the means provided for attaching the spoon to the bottle allows the spoon to be securely positioned only outside of the bottle. This outside position is, of course, the operative position. However, when the device is not being used, as thus constructed, it is undesirably bulky and irregularly shaped so that it does not facilitate ready storage. Furthermore, the bowl of the spoon and the open stem end in communication therewith are both in an exposed position. Consequently, contamination of the bowl and of the interior of the device and any ingredients therein by foreign matter entering through the exposed open end is possible. In addition, the container must be maintained in an upright position to prevent spilling of the ingredients therein.\nThe present invention features a spoon feeding device having means to eliminate these undesirable characteristics. By virtue of the novel means comprising the present invention, the spoon may be secured within the container when the device is not being used, as well as being positioned in the conventional outside position when use is required. When the spoon is situated in the inside position the device is considerably more compact. Consequently storage is more readily facilitated.\nFurthermore, securing the spoon inside the bottle not only removes the bowl and open stem end from their exposed positions, but also enables emplacement of a cap over the container opening, thus completely enclosing the interior thereof, and effectively eliminating the possibility of contamination by foreign matter. In addition, with the cap emplaced, the likelihood of spilling of the liquid ingredients within the container is substantially eliminated.\nTherefore, it is a primary object of this invention to provide a spoon feeding device having means for securely attaching a hollow stemmed spoon to an open-end container alternatively in either an inside or an outside position.\nA further object of this invention is to provide a spoon feeding device which is compact and readily storable when immediate use is not required.\nAnother object is to provide a spoon feeding device which is not susceptible to contamination and can be maintained in a sanitary condition when not needed for immediate use.\nStill another object is to provide a spoon feeding device having means for substantially eliminating spilling.\nOtherobjects and advantages are inherent in the structure claimed and disclosed, and will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein:\nFig. l is an exploded perspective view of the spoon feeding device.\nFig. 2 is a vertical sectional view of the spoon feeding device with the spoon in an outside position.\nFig. 3 is a vertical sectional view of the spoon feeding device with the spoon in an inside position.\nReferring to Fig. 1, the numeral 10 indicates a bottle or container having an externally threaded neck 11 with a top opening generally indicated at 12. Container 10 is made of a resilient material such as plastic so as to be readily squeezeable. The numeral 13 generally indicates spoon means comprising a hollow conical stem or tubular portion 14 and a bowl 15; extending angularly therefrom. Hollow stem 14, as indicated in Figs. 2 and 3, has two open ends 16, 17. Open end 16, at the narrowest extreme of conical stem 14, is in communication with bowl 15 of spoon 13. Open end 17, at the broadest extreme of stem 15, has a flange 18 extending outwardly therefrom. Flange 18 is adapted to engage the top of neck 11 when spoon means 13 is positioned either outside of container 10 in the manner shown in Fig. 2 or within container 10 in the manner shown in Fig. 3. An internally threaded cylindrical collar 20 engages externally threaded neck 11 so as to secure spoon means 13 to container 10 in either of the positions shown in Figs. 2 and 3 wherein the axis of stem 14 is substantially colinear with the axis of container 10.\nWhen spoon means 13 is attached to container 10 in the manner shown in Fig. 2, open end 17 of hollow stem 14 is in communication with opening 12 in container neck 13 and open end 16 and bowl 15 are outside of container 10. This is the operative position for spoon means 13.\nBowl 15 is inclined from stem 14 at an angle which enables spoon means 13 to be placed within container 10 in the manner shown in Figure 3.\nWhen spoon means 13 is in the outside or operative position (Fig. 2), a surface 24 of flange 18 engages neck 11. When spoon means 13 is in the inside position (Fig. 3), an opposite surface 25 of flange 18 engages neck 11. Flange 18 has a diameter greater than that of neck 11; consequently, it completely overlaps neck 11 as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.. The inner diameter of cylindrical collar 20 is greater than the diameter of flange 18. Consequently collar 20 will fit around flange 18. At one end of cylindrical collar 20 is an inwardly extending flange 21. The inner periphery of flange 21 of collar 20 has a diameter less than the diameter of flange 18. Consequently flange 21 will engage flange 18 when collar 20 is fitted around flange 18. When spoon means 13 is in the inside position (Fig. 3), flange 21 will engage surface 24 of flange 18. When spoon means 13 is inthe outside position (Fig. 2), flange 21 will engage the opposite surface 25 of flange 18.\nBowl 15 is inclined with respect to stem 14 so that when bowl 15 is held horizontally in a feeding position, hollow stem 15 and container 10 are inclined upwardly therefrom, thus enabling gravity flow of ingredients from container 10 through stem 14 to bowl 15. When so held, the top edge 19 of bowl 15 lies in a plane above a parallel plane 23 passing through the uppermost point 26 of the interior surface 30 of hollow stem 14sat opening 16. Consequently when the level of liquid in bowl 15 reaches that of the latter plane 23, air cannot enter container and the natural flow of liquid into bowl ceases. Therefore, the level ofli'quid in bowl 15 resulting from natural flow is maintained lower than bowl edge 19.\nWhen spoon 13 'is in the inside position (Fig. 3), a cap 22 of any conventional type and having an inner diameter greater than the outer diameter of collar fits overv collar 20 so as to cover hole -17 in stem 14. 7\n,It is tobe understood that the specific embodiments of the invention shown in the drawings and described above are merely illustrative of several of the many forms which the invention may takeain practice and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention defined in the appended claim which is to be interpreted as broadly as possible in viewof the prior art.\nI claim:\n' A device for spoon-feeding fluids or semi-fluids, said device comprising a container of a relatively large diameter body formed of plastic material and having a thin resiliently yieldable' circumferential wall adapted to be deformed manually while in use to effect discharge of its contents, said container having an open end and terminating at said open end in externally threaded neck portion, spoon means having a hollow conical stem and a bowl extending angularly therefrom, said hollow stem having a first open end in communication with said bowl and a second open end, said spoon means having flange 2,953,170 p a a 4 ends and having an inner diameter slightly greater than said diameter of, said flange means on said spoon means i and having circular flange means extending inwardly at means extending outwardly around said second open end,\nthe outer periphery of said flange means being of a shape an internally threaded cylindrical collar having two open one open end with an inner diameter slightly smaller than said diameter of said flange means on said spoon means, said collar being efieotive when assembled with the'spoon means and the container to retain the spoon means in fully assembled condition with'the container, in either one of two positions with the axis of said hollow stem being substantially co-linear with the axis of the container, in one of said positions said spoon means will be disposed entirely, the interior of the container and in the other of said positions, said spoon means will be disposed so as to extend from the neck portion of said container and in direct communication with the interior of the container, said first open end of said stem lying substantially below the open periphery of said spoon bowl when the, spoon means are assembled for feeding position with said-container and said spoon bowl is disposed substantially horizontally whereby said fluid in said bowl is maintained below said upper-periphery, and a cap having an inner diameter greater than the outer diameter of the cylindrical collar fitting over said cylindrical collar when the spoon means are disposed within the container to fully cover and seal the container.\nReferences Cited in the file of this patent UNITED STATES PATENTS 1,387,211 Sweeney Aug. 9, 1921 1,642,425 Miller Sept. 13, 1927 2,252,119 Edmonds Aug. 12, 1941 2,546,681 Searer Mar. 27, 1951 2,736,469 Stone Feb. 28, 1956 2,757,831 r Schmidt Aug. 7, 1956"

Renewed Septemberlz. 1907- Serial No. 394,412.\nTo all whom it may concern:\nBe it known that I, HERBERT M. STURGIS, a citizen of the United States, residing at Kansas City, in the county of Jackson and State of Missouri, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Loose-Leaf Books, of which the following is a specification.\nThis invention relates to loose leaf books of that class in which the leaf-holding rings are held open or closed with a yielding pressure and my object is to' produce a device of this character in which the anchoring elements may be bound to the cover and the leaf holding elements be subsequently connected thereto easily and quickly and also be removed therefrom if desired.\nA further object is to produce bars to which the hooks can be easily and quickly secured so firmly and reliably as to be incapable of working loose under any strain to which the book may be subjected by a fall or from opening or closing the rings.\nA still further object is to produce a loose leaf book which will operate efficiently and reliably, is of ornamental and attractive appearance and can be manufactured economically.\nWith these general objects in view andothers as hereinafter appear the invention consists in certain novel and peculiar fea tures of construction and organization as hereinafter described and claimed; and in order that it may be fully understood reference is to be had to the accompanying drawings, in which- Figure 1, is a sectional perspective view of a loose-leaf book when open and with the leaves omitted. Fig. 2, is a detail perspective view of the anchor plate. Fig. 3, is an enlarged cross section taken on the line IIIIII of Fig. 1. Fig. 4, is a similar view with the rings open and the cover and anchoring elements omitted. Fig. 5, is a sectional perspective view of one of the hookcarrying bars with the hooks omitted. Fig. 6, is a sectional perspective view of one of the hooks. Fig. 7, is a detail perspective view of one of the springs. Fig. 8, is a sectional view of a modified form of hook-carrying bar. Fig. 9, is a cross section of the hookcarrying bars with the hooks omitted, and showing a pin and slot connection between the bars to insure synchronous movement thereof. Fig. 10, is a side view of a semi-el liptic or modified form of spring.\nIn the said drawings, where like reference numerals identify corresponding parts, 1 indicates an anchor plate of segmental form in cross section and rounded by preference at its ends and near the latter slit inwardly at opposite points as at 2 so that the rounded ends may be bent vertically upward to form end walls 3, which end walls are preferably provided with holes 4.\n5 indicates a pair of elliptic springs corresponding by preference in size and contour to the end walls 3 andprovided in their ends by preference with holes 6, rivets 7 being secured in the holes 4 and 6 to secure the springs reliably to the inner sides of said end; walls, the rivets fitting loosely in either the end walls or the springs in order to permit the latter to expand and contract.\n8-8 indicate a pair offlattened tubular bars which conjointly are about equal in width to the length of the elliptic-spring openings, and each of said bars are of length to project at their ends into said openings, the said projecting ends of the bars being preferably of reduced thickness as at 9 with their outer ends referably rounded as at 10 so as to fit snug ly and find journals in the opposite extremities of the openings of said sprmgs.\n1112 indicate segmental hooks of the type common in loose leaf books, their free or upper ends being adapted to interlock together to form complete rings. Their opposite ends extend into the tubular bars through openings 13 in their upper walls as in the preferred construction, or in their outer edges as in the modified form of bar shown by Fig. 8. The inner ends of said hooks are preferably reduced to form substantially rectangular tongues 15 to fit nonrotatably in correspondingly shaped holes 14 in the inner walls or edges of the tubular bars and be riveted therein so as to guard against dislocation. By this construction I provide hook-carrying bars in which it is absolutely impossible for the hooks to have any lateral play or movement and whichare so stiff and rigid throughout that any outward pull or pressure applied on one pair of hooks is distributed upon all of them so that it is impossible for one pair of hooks to move slightly apart without all partaking of such movement in equal degree. In all otherdevices of this class of which I have knowledge the bars 8 are of flat thin metal and on any outward pull applied on either of the end sets of hooks will yield or twist slightly and permit said hooks to open a little before the hooks at the opposite end or the intermediate hooks will move. As a result of this leaves of the books equipped with such devices occasionally become loose at one end and are therefore more apt to be torn in the ordinary handling of the book.\nIn assembling the parts of the book the companion hooks are fitted together at their tendency of the springs to contract transversely or in their direction of their greatest length holding the hooks yieldingly interlocked at their upper ends and with the inner upper corners of the bars in engagement IVhen therings are opened by pulling outward upon a pair of the oppositely disposed hooks, said upper corners, in the upward rocking movement of the bars, elongate the springs in the direction of their length and as said engaging corners pass above the horizontal plane of the bearing edges 10 the spring contracts in the direction of its length until the inner walls or edges of the tubular bars come squarely together as shown in Fig. 4, in which position they are held by the retractile tendency of the springs, and in this connection it will .be noted that because of the depth of the inner edges or walls, the upward and downward movements of the bars is synchronous, though if desired suitable means may be provided for slidingly locking said bars at their inner edges, one exemplification of such means being shown in Fig. 9, where it. will be noticed the inner edge of one bar is provided with a slot 16 and the correspondingedge of the other with a pin or tongue 17 slidingly engaging said slot.\nThe anchor plate can be secured to the cover A in any suitable manner, the preferred method being to place a strip of cloth or equivalent material 18 upon the middle of the cover, then place thereon a metal plate 19 segmental in cross section and provided at its side margins with inwardly disposed and upwardly projecting hooks 20, and next stretch loosely over said last-named plate the binder strip 2]. of thin flexible leather or cloth and secure the opposite edges of said binder strip to the inner sides of the cover in the usual or any preferred manner. The anchor plate is then by preference placed upon the binder strip and pressure is applied to spring or slip it into engagement with the hooks 20, the binding strip being of course interposed between the anchor plate and the hook-equipped plate. When the anchor plate is thus secured the hooks 20 are pressed or crimped downward to effect a permanent union with said plate. It is preferred that the anchor plate be bound to the cover beery and that the remaining elements may be subsequently secured to the anchor plate easily, quickly and cheaply. The book will be provided with the usual perforated leaves,\nnot shown, to be placed upon or removed from the hooks in the usual manner.\nIn Fig. 10, I show a modified form of spring, the same being a semi-elliptic spring 22 which in all essential particulars comprises the upper half of one of the springs 5, the cavities 23 forming the bearing points for the bearing edges 10 of the reduced ends 9 of the tubular bars 8.- The spring is also provided with holes 24 to receive the rivets 7 or equivalent devices for securing it to the end walls 3 of the anchor plate.\nFrom. the above description it will be apparent that I have produced a loose leaf book possessing the features of advantage enumerated as desirable and which obviously may be modified in various particulars with.- out departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims;\nHaving thus described the invention what I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters-Patent, is\n1. In a loose leaf book, a tubular bar hav ing a pair of openings, and a hook extending through one of said openings into said bar and riveted in the other opening.\n2. In a loose leaf book, a flattened tubular bar provided with openings one of which has its base end reduced and fitting non-rotata bly and riveted in said angular opening.\n3. In a loose leaf book, a pair of hook-carrying bars, an integrally formed elliptic spring inclosing one end of the hook-carrying bars, and a similar spring inclosing the other end of the hook-carrying bars, the opposite ends of the elliptic openings of said springs forming bearings for the outer edges of the inclosed portions of the bars and holding said bars yieldingly together at their inner edges with the upper ends of the hooks apart or with the upper ends of the hooks together and the inner upper edges of the bars together and disposed below the plane of their outer edges.\n4. In a loose leaf book, an anchor plate of segmental form in cross section and provided with upwardly projecting end walls, springs fitting and secured against the inner sides of the end. walls, bars having their ends projecting into the openings of said springs and pressed by the latter yieldingly together, and\nsets of hooks rigidly secured to and projecting upwardly above said bars and adapted to be held yieldingly together or apart by the contractile pressure of the springs on the bars.\n5. In a loose leaf booki, a pair of bars e ui ed withhooks, curve s ri sengaging tl ie O IIllZGI ed es of the ends 0? s a i d bars and pressing the latter yieldinglytogether, an anchor plate below the bars and provided at its ends with walls projecting upwardly at the outer sides of said sprin s, and means for fastening the latter to said walls without preventing said springs from exerting continuously a yielding inward pressure on the bars.\n6. In aloose leaf book, a pair of bars equippe d with hooks, curved springs engagin the outer edges of the ends of said bars an pressing the latter yieldingly together, an anchor plate below the bars and provided at its ends with walls projecting upwardly at the outer sides of said springs, and means for fastening the latter to said walls Without preventing said springs from exerting continuously a yielding pressure on the bars, in combination with a plate underlying the anchor plate and provided with hooks extending upward and inward around and over the side edges of said plate, a cover, and a binder strip hooked around and in said hooks and interposed and clamped between the same and the anchor plate and secured at opposite sides of said plates to the cover.\n7. In a loose leaf book, a cover, a plate secured to the cover and provided with upwardly projecting and inwardly disposed hooks at its sides, a binder strip secured at opposite sides to the inner side of the cover and hooked around and within said hooks and resting upon said plate, and an anchor plate upon said binder strip and having its side edges projecting into the hooks with the binder strip interposed and clamped tightly between them.\n8.

As a preferred means to iushl the said surface I have, in this embodimentof the invention, shown the feces receiving casting 1 as provided at a suitable point with a fiushing rim 7, having therein a` encirclin water su ply passage 8 provide at suitab e interva s with discharge openings 9 and communicating with a source of water or iiushi'ng medium supply which is shown in Fi 2 as located beneath the liooringat 10 an communicati'ng by suitable pipeswith the flushing rim. The liushingl rim, if this type of flushing means be emp oyed, may if desired bein open communication with the source 'of water supply or a valve may be provided to be operated either automatically, or otherwlse.- y\nIn order that the closet may be used by vone when assuming a squatting or erouching erence to the feces receiving surface that the body of the -user when crouched upon the said sup ort or supports may be. properly resented) with regard to the saidsurface.\nn the present type of the invention I have shown separated foot supports 11 and 12, as clearly shown in Fig. 1, the user1 assuming theproper position thereon preferably with his face to the right viewing Fig. 1. While a single foot support may be used, I preferably employ two, as shown, and Whlle the same may be located in any proper position relative to the feces receiving surface to permit the described operation of the closet, I preferably locate the said support or supports within the boundary of t e ilushed or casting 1 but they may be otherwise formed and secured in an vdesired manner. They are also preferab y, as shown in Fig. 2, raised from the face of the said surface, which is herein shown as sloping downward from all sides to the discharge outlet or outlets. The upper surface of the foot support or supports may be fashioned in any desired manner but are herein shown as corru ated or roughened to provide a firmer foot old. If desired, and as here shown, the said foot supports may have u standing surroundin rims preferablv per orated and be face with some pre erably rough material, such as rubber, waxed fiber, or the like, to secure easier and firmer footing, and may be provided with de ending gulding rims as shown. The upturned) perforated rims protect the foot-rests against the splashing of Water while the perforations permit them to be flushed and drained when desired and thereby kept clean and sanitary. The location of the foot-rests so as to be entirely surrounded by the flushed and drained area keeps them and adjacent surfaces clean and free from all foulness. If desired, removable foot pieces, impervious or otherwise, may be provided for the foot receiving surfaces.\nIn order to drain or flush the feces receiving surface water or other iiushing medium may be supplied in any desired manner to any suitable form of flushing device. To render the closet thoroughly sanita I preferably em loy means whereby the c oset may be fiushe while in use, either by a constantly flowing stream of flushing medium or by automatlc or other means for flushing during use of the closet. When a flushing rim is employed, as herein shown, I referably provlde automatic means for ushing the surface, though it is obvious that a constantly flowing stream may be emlployed, and as a type of such iushin means ave herein shown a valve 13, pre erably located in a suitable valve casing 14;, preferably connected with the water entrance ipe 10, the valve stem being shown as exten ed upward and receiving upon the upper and prefer- 50' ably enlarged end 15 thereof the vertically movable valve operating member 16 whic may be provided at any suitable or convenient point, but which I have herein shown as located upon one of the foot supports, as having a de ending flan e 17 an as normally space above the oot support by a suitable coiled spring 18, surroundin the valve stem and normally acting to hol the valve in a closed ositlon. I ma employ any desired type o valve and may ocate the same at any suitable or desired point. In the described construction the iiushing will continue so long as the user maintains his position upon the foot su ports but if desired any other form of ius mg device, whether automatic or otherwise, may be employed and to that end in Fig. 3 is represented as a single ty ethereof,a iiushing tank 19, havnig a depen ing chain or other operating means 20 b which the iushing medium may be supp ied to the iushing rim 7 or in any other siutable manner to the feces receiving surface or any desired portion thereof. While the flushing medium may be applied to only a limited portion of the feces receiving surface yet I preferably supply the entire area of said surface therewith in order to kee the closet in a sanitary condition and to thls end the flushing rim is shown in Fig. 1 as entirely encircling thereceiving surface.\nIf desired, the water closet may be used also as a ,urinal and to that end any suitable urinary apparatus may be provided, but in this embodiment of the invention I contemplate the use of one wall of the closet for urinary purposes and (Figs. 2 and 3) have shown the wall 21 as adapted for that purpose, the same being preferably and as herein shown opposite the door 22 of the closet so that the user stands upon foot supports l1 and 12 and facing in an opposite 'dlrection to that assumed when using the closet as such. In order to facilitate the use of the device as a urinal when the latter is located as herein shown, the foot su ports 11 and 12 may be placed in pai-alle position instead of slightly diverglng as shown so as to adapt the same for convenient use for either purpose.\nIt is apparent that a urinal of the type shown or of any other desired type may be used independently of the closet, that is, that it is capable of general use as a urinal. In that type of urinal wherein a vertical wall is employed, as well as in that type of urinal known as the attached wall urinal, whereinabowl is suitably secured to a wall, it is a common practice to iiush or drain the wall or the bowl or attached wall type of urinal as by a horizontally dis osed pipe placed a suitable distance above t e lower edge of the wall or above the receiving surface of the bowl or attached wall type of urinal, from which water constantly flows down its urine receiving surface. Thls type of urinal is obj ectionable for 011e reason in that the iooring in the vicinity of the urinal becomes 'foul and unsanitary in spite of the iushinfr -referred to, the water employed for which is generally conducted off by a narrow trough at the base thereof. Again, urinals of every type are liable to become foul and unsanitary at the base thereof because of the lack of adequate liushing means. But especially and in order\" that a urinal of the bowl or attached wall t pe, or any other suitable type, may be t oroughly sanitary it is highly desirable that the surface thereof may e` wet with a flushing medium when used and that the urine be not received upon a dry surface. The after flushing of the used surface does not result in a sanitary `urmal. `and other ob `|ect1ons, and in order to render '10 overcome the above enumerated the urinal thoroughly sanitary, I herein not only flush the standing surface for the user of a urinal, or parts adjacent thereto, but I also flush the receiving surfaces of the urinal, of whatsoever type employed, in such a manner that the said surface is' wet with a flushing medium when the urine is received thereon, in contra-distinction to permittmg the urine to be received upon an otherwise dry surface which is afterward flushed. lIn the present embodiment of the invention I contemplate accomplishing this object by automatically flushlng the receiving surface of the urinal as the same is used. Thus in applyin my invention either to a urinal of the bow or attached wall type or to the type of urinal herein shown, I preferably not only Hush the urine receiving surface as the urinal is used, and preferably automatically through the foot of the user, but I preferably tlnsh the base or standing portlon for the user in the vicinity of the wall serving as a urinal or whereon the urinal is attached, preferably providing in the flushed area of the base or closely adjacent thereto suitable and preferably non-Hushed foot supports. By this arrangement the urinal and its surroundings are kept in a sanitary condition. In flushing adjacent surfaces, I Amay employ a constantly flowing stream of flushing medium, or may employ automatic or other means for flushing such surface or surfaces at intervals, but I have herein shown means for automatically iushing the same during use.\nIn the illustrated embodiment of my invention, the automatically controlled flushing pipe (Fig. 2)' leading to the flushing rim 9 has an upwardly leading extension having suitable connection with the horizontal perforated pipe 25 located at the front o the urine-receiving wall 21 so that the automatic iiushing of this surface at the time of its use is secured. It will be seen that, while this provides for the sanitary flushing of the urine-receiving wall while it is in use, the water is automatically shut olf at all times when the urinal is out of use.\nIf desired, the constant supplyA of flushing water referred to may be applied to the wall 21. through the tank supply pipe which latter is provided with a downturned portion (Fig. 3) connected to the perforated pipe 25 through the valve 23 by which it may be shut otl' or turned on as desired.\nThe closet is ireferably provided with four inclosing walls, as shown in Fig. 1, one of which is herein desi ed as a urinal, the wall 21 adapted for this purpose having an overlapping rim 24 either at its lower edge only or upon the sides also, to alord a sanitary connection between the same and the receiving portion thereof which in the presy Having thus described one type of embodiment of myinvention and the principles of use thereof, I wish it to be understood that although I have described the same specifically yet the descriptive terms are used in their generic sense and not as a matter of limitatlon and that the invention is set forth in the following claims.\nClaims:\n1.

EDWARD OGDEN, 0F MOUNTAINVILLE, NEW YORK.\nDOOR.\nSpecification of Letters Patent.\nPatented Oct. 22, 1918.\nApplication filed March 8, 1917. Serial No. 153,246.\n, To all whom it may concern:\nMy invention relates to sectional doorswhich are elevated in opening and transfer a portion of the weight to an auxiliary support. Furthermore, it has special reference to large, heavy doors which are adapted for warehouses, pier sheds and the like.\nOne object of my invention is to equip a sectional door of the aforesaid character with a movable member, such as, for example, an\narm or lever which is adapted to be retracted when the door is closed and automatically moved into position to engage a bracket or other suitable auxiliary support when the door is in its open position.\nAnother object is to provide a folding door having a movable arm or other member which is adapted to be moved in response to the relative movement or folding action of the door sections into a position to engage a stationary bracket or other auxiliary support when the door is opened.\nIn order that my invention may be thoroughly understood 1 will now proceed to describe the same in the following specification, and then point out the novel features thereof in appended claims.\nReferring to the drawings:\nFigure 1 is a sectional elevation of a door equipped with one embodiment of my invention.\nFig. 2 is a view corresponding to Fig. 1, but showing the door in its open instead of in its closed position.\nFig. 3 illustrates a modified door structure which also embodies my invention. This is also a sectional elevation and corresponds to Fig. 2 except that the door is not com pletely opened.\nIn the drawings, designates a post and 11 the lintel of a door frame. The door comprises an upper section 12 hinge-connected above the lintel at 13, an intermediate section 14 connected by hinges 15 to the section 12and a sliding bottom section 16. My invention is equally applicable to two section doors and in fact is applicable to doors of various types.\nIn the arrangement shown the intermediate section 14 has guideways 17 in which the bottom section runs and the bottom section has rollers 18 or other projections which engage the door posts and may cooperate with guides (not shown) thereon in a well known manner.\nSecured to the upper door section 12 is a bracket 20 on which a bell crank lever having arms 21 and 22 is pivotally mounted. The arm 21 of the bell crank lever has an extension 23 with which one end of a'spring 24 is connected. The other arm 22 has a roller or wheel 25 which is adapted to engage a suitable auxiliary support, such as the stationary bracket 26, which is suspended from ceiling beams 27 and may form part of the ceiling'st ructure. The hoisting mechanism for the door may be of the usual type and is designated 28.\nA link 29 is pivotally connected at 30 to the intermediate door sectionld and is provided with a slot 31 near its opposite end which provides a lost motion connection between the link and the arm 21 of the bell crank lever. The other end of spring 24 is connected with this link 29 at 32. The arrangement of parts is such that when the door is shut, as shown in Fig. 1, the arm 21 is substantiall parallel to the plane of the door section 12, and when'the-door is opened the bell crank lever will be swung into the position illustrated'in Fig. 2, as soon as it is in position for its roller 25 to ride on top of the support 26 with the arm21sub'stantially perpendicular to the plane of the door section 12. e\nIn other words, the bell crank lever is swung by the link 29 relative to the door section when the doorsection is completely opened so that the roller arm is substantially parallel to the plane of the door section 12 and extends outwardly beyond the door section into engagement with the stationary support 25. t The lost motion provided by the slot 31 allows for an increase of the distance between the pivotal connection 30 and the pin on bell crank lever arm 21 during a part of the folding movement of the door sections,\nyam\nwithout pulling the arm 21 back, as the backward movement of the arm may be limited.\nlhe door shown in Fig. 3 in which corresponding parts are designated by the same reference characters, is pro vided with a bell crank lever 53 pivoted at as on the upper door section 12 (and connected to an arm which is mounted to slide in a bracket 36 near the bottom edge of the upper door section 12, 1\nA roller 3? is mounted on the arm 85 near ts outer end which extends beyond the fracliet 36 and sf 38 is arrangel to rot act the es and hold the roller 3? clo to the bracket 38 except when the door is fully opened,\nThe complete closing of the section Acupon the section 122 actuates the downwardly extending arm 39 of the bell cranlr lever 33 and forces the arm outward in opposition to the spring 38. The roller 3? then rides onto the stationary support 26 and constitutes a simple ef ective means for trans- -fer-ring a part of the weight of? the door to the auxiliary support,\nVarious structural modifications may he eh'ected with n the spirit and scope of my invention, and r if nd only such limitations are indicated by the appended claims, What claim is:\nl.

KING, OF MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY.\nFRYING-PAN.\nSpecification of Letters Patent.\nPatented Nov. 15, 1921.\nApplication filed March 26, 1920. Serial No. 368,895.\nTo all whom it may concern:\nBe it known that I, JOHN G. KING, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Morristown, county of Morris, and State of New Jersey, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Frying-Pans, of\nwhich the following is a specification.\nThis invention relates to an improved frying pan that is constructed particularly for frying articles that areapt to be broken or have their appearance spoiled by excessive handling or by over-turning and taking them from the pan, and is particularly adapted for frying such articles as eggs.\nThe frying pan is constructed so that sufficient surface is presented for the proper frying of eggs and the like, but what, for clearness, I will designate as the front of the pan, is inclined so that it presents not a too abrupt juncture with the bottom, merging therewith in a gentle curve and presenting a substantially smooth fiat portion so that when it is tilted an egg or the like will slide along this delivery portion and be deposited on a plate or other article without any possibility of breaking it.\nThe invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a top view of my improved frying pan, and Fig. 2 is a section on line 2-2 in Fig.1.\nThe frying pan has a substantially fiat bottom 10, which is of any desired area and is provided with a flange 11 which extends around the back and the sides and is preferably continued toward the front, merging into the flat front portion 12, which is inclined upwardly from the bottom, merging therewith, as at13, in a curve which is not abrupt, and having its front edge 14 preferably made straight and giving a wide front edge, so that food, such as eggs, which has been fried in the pan, when the pan is tilted passes down this delivery portion 12, so that it is not necessary to lift the ma terial from the pan and over the flange, and\nin this way the frying pan not only becomes a cooking utensil, but also the means by which the material is delivered to a plate.\nThe frying pan is provided with a handle, which I prefer to place at the side, the handle 15 extending laterally and horizontally, or slightly inclined from the horizontal, and is disposed so that the weight of the pan is approximately balanced by the handle, so that when it is tilted there is but slight effort required.\nI claim:\n1. A frying pan having a substantially flat bottom with a flange at the back and sides and having its front part upwardly inclined to form a smooth and substantially fiat portion which merges without abruptness into the bottom and is of substantially the same width for its entire length.\n2. A frying. pan having a substantially flat bottom with a flange at the back and sides and having its front part upwardly inclined to form a smooth and substantially flat portion which merges without abruptness into the bottom, the flange being gradually flattened toward the front so as to form a continuous straight front edge to the pan, said flat portion being without constriction so that flat, thin articles of considerable area can be delivered from the pan without material disarrangement.\nA frying pan having a substantially flat bottom with a flange at the back and sides and having its front part upwardly inclined to form a smooth and substantially flat portion of equal width throughout which mergeswithout abruptness into the bottom, and a handle projecting horizontally from the side of the pan at approximately the center.\nIn testimony that I claim the foregoing, I have hereto set my hand, this 24th day of March, 1920.\nJOHN G. KING."

BELL, OF WASHINGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBA.\nSPEAKING-TELEPHONE.\nSPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 250,704, dated December 13, 1881.\ni Application filed December 2G, 1879.\nTo all whom it may concern iBe it known that I, ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL, of Washington, District of Columbia, have invented an Improvement in Speaking- Telephones, of which the following is a specitication. v\nThis invention relates to telephones having an ear-piece or sound-conveying tube in addition to the ordinary mouth-piece; and it consists in arranging the saidear-pieee or soundconveying tube on the opposite side of the diaphragm or vibrating plate from the mouthpiece. Additional sound-conveyin g tubes communicating with the diaphragmchamber on the same or ou opposite sidcsotthe diaphragm can be used.\nIn the accompanying drawings, which form a part of this specification, Figure 1 is a plan and Fig. 2 a sectional view of a telephone embodying the invention.\nAis the table to which the instrument is attached.\nB B are two blocks of wood held together by screws a, and between which is clamped a diaphragm of thin metal, d, as shown. The blocks B B are, one or both of them, secured tothe table by screws. (Not shown.) Their inner faces are concaved, as shown, to form a chamber, G,within which the diaphragm may vibrate. The front block, B, has an opening for the insertion of the mouth-piece M, and the rear block, B', has an opening for the insertion of one end of an electro-magnet, E, the other end of which is made fast to a bracket, b, screwed to the table, as' shown. The electro-magnet E has a polarized core. Two screw-cups in the table, connected with the electro-magnet by wires, are marked s s.\nD D are two trumpet-shaped ear-pieces, counected by flexible tubes with the chamber on either side of the diaphragm, the tubes for that purpose passing through openings or slots in vthe blocks B B.\nThe operation is as follows: The person about to talk with the telephone holds one ot' the ear-pieces D tohis ear and talks in front of the mouth-piece M in the ordinary manner, pinching the exible tube, however, while he himselt' is talking to prevent the unpleasant sensation of hearing his own voice through the instrument; but when receiving a reply through the same instrument as a receiver he. releases the tube from the extra pressure ot the fingers and hears the return message through the ear-piece at his ear.\nIt is obvious that conversation can be carried on more readily than when the operator alternately speaks and listens at the mouthpiece.\nIt is also obvious that where two ear-pieces are attached to the telephone, as shown in the drawings, two persons can receive a message at the same time. might be made to communicate with the chamber within the instrument; but for ordinary purposes one tube provided with an ear-piece in addition to thev mouth-piece is suflicient, and it is immaterial whether the tube communicates with the chamber in front of or in rear ot' the diaphragm.\nWhen more than one ear-piece are attached it may be convenient for the operator to einploy one of them for a mouth-piece.\nHaving thus fully described my invention and the manner in which the same is or may be carried into effect, what I claim, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-\nA telephone iu which the receiving and transmitting apertures are placed upon opposite sides ofthe vibrating plate and provided with devices for communicating with the ear and mouth, respectively.\nALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL.\nWitnesses:\nG.J.

The present invention relates to baseball gloves and is directed to a glove of novel contour and constructionparticularly adapted to be worn by players occupying those infield positions, other than'first 'bas e, where most of the batted balls that are fielded are rolling or bouncing upon the ground.\nAn object of the invention is to provide a baseball glove having greatly improved ball catching qualities due to the fact that two certain finger stalls of the glove are integrally joined together by a solid web and that web strengthened and reenforced in a novel manner by an interlaced thong.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide in a baseball glove having the foregoing characteristics, a dual finger construction that will func-. tion to initially snare and efi'ectively direct to the glove pocket a so-called \"ground ball which moves rapidly upon the ground and is best caught by a player wi h a scooping action of his gloved hand.\nA further object of the invention is to provide a baseball glove construction which will effectively protect a players second and third fingers from injury by reenforcing the particular finger stalls upon which a well caught, ground ball usually impinges before it enters the glove ball pocket.\nOther objects of my invention will appear from the following description and the accompanying drawings in which similar characters of reference indicate similar parts throughout the several views.\nIn the drawings:\nFig. 1 is a perspective view of the front or in baseball glove.\nFig. 2 is a perspective view of the rear of the glove depicted' in Fig. 1.\nFig. 3 is an enlarged section taken on line 3-3 of Fig. 1. r I\nFig. 4 is a section taken on line 4-4 of Fig. 3.\nIn the drawin the numeral 6 refers to a base ball glove comprising a palm piece 1 formed from an integral sheet of leather and including the front portion of a thumb stall 8 secured to the palm piece I by a welted seam 9. A composite back piece ill-is joined to the palm piece along its marginal edges partly by a welted seam l l and on the sides of the glove by integral leather portions, said pieces forming a thumb section l2 and a fingers section 13. As illustrated in Fig. 2 the composite back section is provided with the usual hand opening I4 and an adjustable strap l5. the margins of both being supplied with bound edges l6, saidback piece prejerably havin number of welted. seams l 'l extending from the bottom thereof up to, and meeting, thflwfilllfi seam 9 to secure together ajnumber of; forming sections. The bottom'e'dges of the'back and palm sections are bound and joined together by a laced seam l8, whilst the usual backstop l9 extends between, and is laced to, adjacent porf-i tions of the thumb and fingers sections. '-Ihe front and back pieces may have the usual-ii ings, at least one of which is shown at 20 inFig's. 3 and 4 as a palm piece liner, it being understood that padding is disposed between the piece and liner in such areas and in the amounts necessary to form the desired glove contour.\nThe portions of the palm piece 1 and the back piece I0 which form the fingers section l3 of the glove are provided with two aligned and laterally spaced open-topped slots 2| and 22 which extend heightwise from the glove ball pocket 230 and open out into the upper edge of the said fingers section. The slot 2| is spaced inwardly from the adjacent side of the fingers section to form with the adjacent side a first finger stall 23 for the glove, whilst the remaining slot 22 is spaced inwardly from the opposite side of the fingers section to form a smallfinger stal1 24. The palm and back pieces extend solidly between the opentopped slots 2| and 22 to form an intermediate, dual fingers stal1 25-46 between the first and small finger stalls. The dual fingers stall 25-26 are disposed in side-by-side relationship and are joined together by solid web portions 21 and 28 of the palm and back sections I and I0, respectively.\nA row of vertically spaced, aligned openings 29 and 30 are formed in. the web portions of the palm and back pieces respectively, said rows extending from the glove ball pocket to a point adjacent the top of the glove. A dual fingers stall reenforcing thong 3| is interlaced and drawn through the aligned openings 29 and 3B in the respective palm and back pieces of the glove, and. as most clearly shown in Fig. 3, the interlacing of the thong follows the so-called saddler stitch\" wherein corresponding portions of the thong are drawn through opposite sides of each pair of consecutive openings in the row, the center portion of the thong being passed through the lowermost pair of holes therefor. As best shown in Fig. 2 one lateral branch 32 of the thong is laced through the upper end of the dual finger stall 26 and extends across the open- topped slot 22 so that it lashes the small finger stall 24 to the dual fingers stall. The other lateral branch 33 is laced through the upper end of the dual finger stall 25 and connects it to the first finger stall 23.\nThe interlacing of the thong 3! through the row of vertically spaced openings in the palm and back pieces by the so-jcalled \"saddler stitch forms a reenforcing column which extends heightwise along the central part of the dual fingers stall 25-26 thereby strengthening the fingers section around the glove area where ground balls first impinge on the glove before being caught in the ball pocket 239. It will be noted'that the lateral branches 32 and 33 of the reenforcing thong 3| pass in opposite directions through the upper end of the dual fingers stall and thence to the respective finger stalls 23 and 24 to secure the dual stall to said adjacent finger 1 stalls. v Ball impact on the area of the dual fingers r stall, during the catching action, is therefore taken upon the interlaced column and transmitted by its thong branches 32 and 33 to the adjacent finger-stalls and 23 respectivelmand thus materially strengthens the glove at and around the dual fingers stall area for eficctive ball catching purposes.\n' What is claimed is:\n1. A baseball glove having a palm piece and a back piece joined along their marginal edges to forma thumb section and a. fingers section, the portions of the piecesforming the fingers section having two aligned and laterally spaced opentopp d'slotstherein extending heightwise from interlaced and drawn through the row of aligned openings in the web portions of said pieces.\n2.

Schlueter and John R. Guenther, Milwaukee, Wis., assignors to Continental Can Company, Inc., New York, N.Y., a corporation of New York Filed Oct. 8, 195'6, Ser. No. 614,47 9\n3 Claims. (Cl. 35-66) The present invention relates to a new and improved type of chalkboard formed from bibulous sheet material impregnated with a solid organic plastic. More particularly, the present invention is directed to the provision of an improved organic plastic chalkboard and process of forming the same, the chalkboard being made from polyester resins of a type to be described and provided with a polyester overlay surface portion which is internally reinforced by the inclusion therein of dispersed finely ground material.\nChalkboards are nowand have been primarily manufactured from slate, painted hardboard surfaces, opaque glass, and porcelain enameled metal.` Each of these basic types of chalkboards is objectionable in at least one respect either in connection with the manufacturing of the same or subsequent installation and use. Slate, for example, being limited to the well known black color, is somewhat limited in use due to its availability in only moderately sized sheets and, further, due to the difficulties encountered in installing the slate because of its relative fragility. Still further, slate, as in the case of all natural products, is quite variable in quality and this among other characteristics places slate in the category of expensive material. A\nPainted hardboard surfaces are readily prepared in any color and the manufacturing of the same is relatively simplied by use of a paint spraying process. Painted hardboard surfaces are inexpensive and readily available on the present market and, consequently, are widely used. While a good initial surface appearance can be obtained with this type of chalkboard, the surface is comparatively soft, as is common with many different types of painted surfaces, and consequently the painted hardboard surface has very limited resistance to Still further, various types of hardboard adapted for painting to provide a chank-retaining and eraseable surface are generally avaliable in sizes which are limited which restricts the usefulness of` this type of chalkboard.\nOpaque glass with one frosted face can also be made available in almost any color and is wear-resistant to a desirable extent. However, glass chalkboards of this type are limited in size, extremely expensive, fragile, and diliicult to install. Porcelain enameled steel with a matte surface exhibits substantially all of the Ydesirable characteristics of opaque glass while eliminating the undesirable characteristic of fragility. However, porcelain` enameling is an expensive process and has limited resistance to the action of corrosive chemicals.\nWith the advent and widespread use of organic plastics in `many different fields, efforts have been made to provide chalkboards molded or cast from thermoplastic resins lsuch -as polymethyl methacrylate for the purpose of improving on the physical and chemical properties of commercial forms of chalkboards. However, in the case of molded or cast thermoplastic resins ithas been found that themanufacture of chalkboards is overly exanstatt Fatented Oct. 1l, 1960 pensive and these boards are limited as to size and are further unsatisfactory in connection with resistance to this cure.\nwear and solvents. High pressure laminates have been tested in connection with their suitability for use as chalkboards but the principal problem confronting these latter efforts resides in the provision of a uniform, satisfactory writing surface. Still further, chalkboards manufactured in this manner are limited in sheet size due to press limitations.\nWith continued investigations made in the organic plastic resin field, continuous processes such as those disclosed in United States Patent No. 2,496,911 and United States Patent No. 2,528,152 have been found capable of producing organic plastic laminates which are unlimited in size. In continuously forming this type of laminate, polyester resins (hereinafter specified generally as polymerized polyhydric alcohol esters of unsaturated dibasic acids) have been utilized in the impregnating of the fibrous sheet material which is subsequently laminated in a continuous manner, the polyester resin being polymerized to a rigid or flexible thermoset structure without the evolution of any volatile by-product whatsoever. The outstanding characteristic of the polyester resins resides in the non-volatile polymerization step which makes continuous production of laminates possible. Without the presence of a volatile by-produ'ct it is unnecessary to apply pressure during the curing cycle such as is necessary in curing many other types of resins, as, for example, the phenolic, melamine and urea types. While it is `possible to manufacture continuous laminates or sheets from thermoplastic resins, such as the vinyls, polystyrene, methacrylates and cellulose acetate by extruding or coating with the molten polymer, these plastic materials are devoid of the surface hardness, wear resistance, dimensional stability, solvent and corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and permanency of the thermosetting resins such as the polyesters.\nA polyester resin for the purpose of the present invention is a complex product normally prepared by polymerizing the polyhydric alcohol esters of unsaturated dibasic acids. Typical polyhydric alcohols are ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerine, erythritol, pentaerythritol, butylene glycols, 'sorbitoL' and mannitol. Typical unsaturated dibasic acids are maleic, fumarie, and itaconic. The properties of these resins may be modified to obtain variations in ultimate properties by the use of substituted polyhydric alcohols and unsaturated dibasic acids (those in which one or more hydrogen atoms per molecule have been replaced with another element or an organic radical), and by the replacement of a portion of the unsaturated dibasic acids with saturated dibasic acids, such as phthalic, terephthalic, adipic, sebacic, and tetrachlorophthalic, or with chlorendic acid which, though unsaturated, behaves like a saturated compound with respect to polymerization. By these substitutions, resins which yield rigid, exible, lire-resistant or other properties may be obtained.\nResins of the type described may be either thermoplastic, as where the chain-like polymeric ester molecules are not connected to one another', or thermosetting, in the instance Where the chain-like polymeric polyester molecules are interconnected or crosslinked to one another. Commercial polyester resins are usually marketed in an incompletely polymerized form (liquid resin) by their manufacturers and users of these resins can then cure them by advancing the degree of polymerization in a laminating, casting or molding operation. As previously described, no volatile by-products result during Crosslinking the liquid polyester resin molecules by means of monomeric unsaturated molecules such as styrene, methyl styrene, vinyl acetate and methyl methacrylate impart good physical properties to the resin. Because of the generally better results obtained with styrene and the economic advantages inherent in its use, this crosslinking monomer is most commonly used. Consequently, the great majority of all commercially available liquid polyester resins are actually solutions of such resins in monomeric styrene.\nIn generally considering the continuous process of Patent No. 2,496,911, bibulous sheet material is impregnated with liquid organic plastic, such as a polyester resin, and any desired number of plies of the impregnated sheet material are brought together to form a laminate in a continuous manner. The sheet material used may include any natural or artificial material which exists in fibrous form to provide bibulous plastic reinforcement. Reinforcements of prime importance are natural kraft papers, bleached kraft papers, cotton linters and purified alpha cellulose papers. To be adapted for use in the continuous laminating process, the thicker core paper must preferably have better than average mechanical properties, be substantially uniform in caliper and composition, and have a pore structure that will allow for ready impregnation by the resin. The facing sheet may be pigmented or otherwise colored depending upon the desired color of the final product and such pigmentation is readily observable due to the transparency of the polyester resins. Once the desired laminate is formed, a nonbibulous sheet material is used to cover the exposed surfaces of the same so as to retain the shape of the laminated sheet during polymerization and, further, provide the exposed surfaces of the same with the type of finish desired. Polymerization is completed by the application of heat in any suitable manner such as disclosed in the above identified patent.\nIn using the continuous process it is possible to maintain a much closer tolerance in the over-all product as the material forming the product is passed through a set of combining rollers. Once a roll setting is made, the material is uniformly handled throughout any one continuous area. The resultant polyester laminate is readily adapted for many different uses. Such uses include insulation, building materials, luggage covering, advertising displays, etc. As the polyester resins contain no plasticizers, there is no volatile component to escape over a period of years, during the use of the laminate. Still further, due to the completion of polymerization and the presence of a thermoset state, subsequent change in the molecular structure does not take place and no change in physical properties are observable over an extended period of time. Polyester resin laminates are adapted to withstand elevated temperatures, are highly resistant to wear, and are resistant to a wide range of chemicals and food products.\nDue to the presence of the aforementioned desirable properties in polyester resin laminates, and, further, due to the adaptability of these laminates in being formed in a continuous manner thereby eliminating size restrictions, it has been found that by treating the polyester resin laminates in a manner to be described during the continuous formation thereof, a new and improved chalkboard can be continuously fabricated and formed. The chalkboard exhibits the necessary desirable physical and chemical characteristics of existing chalkboards while at the same time overcoming or not exhibiting the various undesirable features or limitations presently encountered in the manufacture and use of chalkboards.\nIt is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved organic plastic chalkboard formed from a polymerized polyester resin reinforced with fibrous sheet material, which chalkboard exhibits over-all composite properties of an improved and lasting nature.\nA further object is to provide a new and improved polyester resin chalkboard laminate having a resin over- 4 lay surface portion internally reinforced with nely ground material, the exposed face of the overlay surface portion being provided with a matte finish which is chalk-retaining while being readily eraseable.\nAnother object is to provide a chalkboard formed from polymerized polyester resin reinforced with bibulous material and being provided with a polymerized resin overlay surface portion exhibiting the desired chemical and physical properties of an appropriate chalk-retaining and eraseable surface, the reinforced polymerized resin chalkboard being adapted for manufacture in either rigid or flexible form and being further readily adapted for mounting on any desirable backing material.\nStill a further object is to provide a new and improved chalkboard formed from polymerized polyester resin laminate provided with a polymerized polyester resin overlay surface portion in which is dispersed finely ground glass and the writing face of which is provided with a flat, uniform, dull finish which is smooth to the touch and which diffuses refiected light uniformly to eliminate observable glare even at a low angle of refraction.\nAn additional object is to provide a process of forming a polyester resin chalkboard laminate which includes steps which can be continuously followed so as to provide uninterrupted operation in the forming of continuous sheets of chalkboard-forming material.\nOther objects not specifically set forth will become apparent from the following detailed description.\nIn the accompanying drawing,\nFigs. 1, 2 and 3 are enlarged diagrammatic sectional views of various forms of laminates of the types to be described.\nThe chalkboard of the present invention as previously described is formed from polymerized polyester resin which in its liquid state has been reinforced by one or more plies of bibulous sheet material and which further has been provided with an overlay surface portion of polyester resin throughout which has been dispersed finely ground reinforcing material. The writing face of the chalkboard, being the exposed surface of the overlay portion, provides a wear and abuse-resistant writing surface which is easily erased and which has minimum shine or glare, both as manufactured and after extended continuous use. This type of chalkboard is readily adapted for manufacture in a continuous manner as discussed above and as disclosed in the aforementioned patents. Consequently, any desired thickness of chalkboard may be produced and the chalkboard may be manufactured as either a rigid or resilient sheet in any desired color as will subsequently be described. Chalkboards of this type are readily backed up with relatively inexpensive material such as masonite, plywood, etc. to obtain the structural rigidity required in use. The chalkboard may be adhered to a backing in the factory and thus sold as mounted sheets or it may be applied to the backing at the site of installation so as to obtain the advantages of a continuous, joint-free writing surface.\nIn forming the chalkboard of the present invention any suitable process can be followed which will provide a reinforced polymerized polyester resin sheet provided with a polymerized polyester resin overlay having dispersed therein a quantity of finely ground reinforcing material such as glass. By referring to glass it is intended to cover an amorphous transparent or translucent brittle material usually made by fusion of silica, soda ash and salt cake or similar materials. Preferably, the continuous types of processes disclosed in the above identified patents are basically used so as to overcome restrictions as to sheet size while at the same time provide uniformity of product. One or more sheets of reinforcing or bulkproviding material, such as kraft paper, alpha cellulose paper or cotton linters, are impregnated with liquid polyester resin formulation. This formulation may be either a rigid type polyesters resin or a flexible type polyester resin depending upon the physical characteristics desired in the end product. The resin formulation will generally consist of a polyestervin styrene'solution and include a suitable polymerization catalyst such as a peroxide. The thickness of the end product Will depend primarily upon the number of plies of impregnated sheets used and impregnation of these sheets may be brought about in any suitable manner.\nAs an example of obtaining impregnation, each sheet may be continuously run through a body of liquid polyester resin formulation and subsequently joined together in face-to-face relation to form a laminate. Some of the sheets may be impregnated and joined with unimpregnated sheets, the excess polyester resin formulation functioning to impregnate the additional sheets combined thereby. This latter procedure is adapted for use where an extremely porous paper, such as cotton linters, is used as reinforcing paper. The impregnated reinforcing sheets are combined by the use of rollers and the thickness of the laminated plies are controlled by the setting of the rollers. Following the formation of the laminate, a surface of the same is passed through a portion of liquid polyester resin formulation which has dispersed throughout therein finely ground glass or anyother suitable reinforcing, abrasive material. Thus,` an o verlay surface portion which should not exceed 0L005 of an inch in thickness is applied to a surface of the uncured laminate, the thickness of the overlay portion being controlled by the passing of the treated laminate through a pair or pairs of rollers of a predetermined spaced setting.\nFig. l diagrammaticallyillustrates a laminate formed from a plurality of reinforcing plies 10, 11 and 12, the ply being a thin facing sheet of the type described in the examples below. The top surface of the laminate is provided with an overlay portion 13 having dispersed within the same finely ground particles of glass. Of course, in the illustration of Pig. l the thickness of the overlay 13 is exaggerated to better illustrate the formation of the chalkboard of the present invention.\nAt this stage of the process a non-bibulous covering material is used to cover both the top and bottom of the laminate so as to encase the'same during polymerization of the polyester'resin formulation. This arrangement is diagrammatically shown in Fig. 2 where sheets 14 and are used to cover the laminate. The non-bibulous encasing material in contactwith the exposed face of the overlay resin, such as the sheet 14 in Fig. 2, should be parchmentized paper capable of providing the overlay resin with a surface nish essentially identical to the writing surface finish desired on the chalkboard. The parchment used must have a uniform, matte surface, the degree of which is capable of providing a flat, uniform, dull surface on the overlay which feels smooth to the touch but diffuses reflected lightrso uniformly that no glare is apparent even at a low angle of refraction. The parchmentized'covering material ,is plasticized-las,` for example, with glycerine and water, and must separate or peel from the finished product following polymerization of the polyester resin formulation. This covering material m-ust also be essentially non-porous, be free of ropy areas, and have sufficient strength to carry the weight of the laminate through the ovens or other polymerization equipment. The parchmentized paper must obviously be easily wetted by the liquid resin in order to provide the degree of matte desired.\nFollowing encasing of the laminate, the entire assembly is carried o n tenter clamps through a series of progessively hotter ovens in the event that the process described in Patent No. 2,496,911 is followed. The cured laminate issuing from the terminal end of the oven is stripped of its encasing webs and either wound into rolls or sheared to desired sheet lengths. It may be passed through a sanding machine to roughen the back surface to make it more adaptable for cementing to a supporting surface with an adhesive which requires a roughened surface.\nIn the mounting of the laminate to a supporting base,\nany suitable type of adhesive may be used. Due to the uniformity of sheet manufacture and the provision of a completely fiat back surface, the laminated sheet may be readily applied to a substrate. Pressure is required only to maintain contact with the glue line and if the glue line has a pronounced initial grab, as in the case of contact adhesives, no special pressure is necessary. Following the gluing operation, any excess laminate sheet material overhanging the edges or cutouts of the substrate may be rapidly trimmed with a file. Arduous sawing often necessary in connection with the use of traditional chalkboard materials is thus entirely avoided. The laminate sheet when formed from flexible polyester resin formulations may be readily coiled thereby allowing self-edging and further adapting the laminate sheet for mounting on contoured surfaces. The polyester resin chalkboard may be adhered to plaster, wallboard, plywood, masonite, or any similar backing material either in wall-to-wall lengths or in segments, as desired.\nThe principal aspects of the chalkboard of the present invention reside in its adaptability for continuous manufacture and the presence of a unique surface which provides a wear and abuse-resistant writing surface that is easily erased and has minimum shine or glare, both as manufactured and after extended continuous use. `Such a surface is attained by the simultaneous use of a powdered-glass loaded overlay resin and a parchmentized paper of the correct texture. The presence of the dispersed powdered glass provides an improved wear resistance and resistance to gloss-up which is not found in known types of organic plastic chalkboards. Any suitable nely ground reinforcing material, such as glass, capable of providing the requisite physical properties may be used.\nThe following examples are illustrative of the organic plastic chalkboard and process of forming the same of the present invention and should not be construed as being limiting with respect thereto:\nExample l A continuous sheet of green pigmented alpha cellulose paper having a thickness of approximately 0.008 of an inch was continuously impregnated with a peroxide catalyzed rigid polyester resin formulation consisting of approximately 65% of a glycol phthalate maleate and approximately 35%, styrene. After a. period of approximately 24 hours at 70 F., the thoroughly impregnated paperwas placed on a continuous laminator and, after passing through one or more dip pans containing a similar resin formulation, was laminated with one or more plies of lkraft paper which had also been passed through the same resin formulation `for pre-impregnation thereby. The alpha cellulose paper formed the face sheet of the laminate which as illustrated in Fig. 1 is the ply 10. Immediately prior to the combining rolls effecting the lamination, an excess of the same polyester resin formulation filled with fine powdered glass of approximately 50 parts glass to parts resin was applied to the top surface of the green facing sheet. On passing through the combining rolls the overlay resin was evenly distributed at a uniform thickness of approximately 0.005 of an inch. Sirnultaneously, the entire laminate including the overlay portion was encased top and bottom in non-porous parchmentized paper of the type capable'of providing the face of the ovelay resin with a matte finish. The entire assembly was then carried on tenter clamps through a series of progressively hotter ovens in the manner described in Patent No. 2,496,911. Following polymerization the laminate was stripped of its covering material and was sheared to desired sheet lengths.\nExample 2 A facing sheet of solid black alpha cellulose paper having a thickness of approximately 0.004 of an inch was preimpregnated with a catalyzed resilient polyester resin 7 formation consisting approximately of 25% of a glycol phthalate maleate and 50% styrene modied by 25% of a glycol adipate maleate. The impregnated facing sheet was then laminated with a number of core sheets in the manner described in Example 1 with the exception that the powdered glass containing the overlay surface portion was formed from the same resilient resin formulation. Parchmentized paper was applied to the top portion of the laminate to thus provide the top encasingweb. The bottom encasing web was formed from glassine. Following polymerization as brought about in the same manner as described in Example 1, the parchmentized paper was stripped from the product and the glassine was removed by sanding.\nExample 3 Example 1 was repeated with the exception that the continuous process described in Patent No. 2,528,152 was followed. As described in this patent, a heated arcuate platen was used in completing polymerization of the polyester resin formulation. In using the heated platen the laminated sheet was run with the overlay portion and facing sheet in contact with the top surface of the platen, the encased laminate being slidably moved over the platen to provide the desired ironing action while being advanced by rollers which maintained uniform tension on the covering sheets to retain the same in rm sliding engagement with the arcuate platen.\nIn referring to the examples it will be noted that a pigmented facing sheet was used in forming the chalkboard. The polymerized polyester resins being transparent allow the use of pigmented facing sheets providing the chalkboard with any desired color. Thus the chalkboard formed in accordance with the principles of the present invention may be made in many different colors to further improve the appearance of the chalkboard as well as adapt the Same for varied uses. The glycol phthalate maleate is readily available commercially. Typical commercial resins are Selectron 5084 of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company and Paraplex P-43 of Rohm & Haas Company. This type of polyester resin is normally sold in a styrene solution of approximately 70% resin and 30% styrene. ditional styrene may be added as desired. The usual technique includes the addition of sufficient styrene to obtain a viscosity that works well with the particular reinforcements under impregnation. Such a viscosity falls generally within the range of about 200 to 1200 cps. The Viscosity of the overlay resin will preferably be higher, such as within the range of about 5,000 to 25,000 cps. With respect to the glycol adipate maleate, saturated dicarboxylic acids other than adipic may be used to attain a flexible resin, Paraplex P-13 of the Rohm & Haas Company is such a flexible polyester resin. In formulating the flexible polyester resin the amount of flexible resin added to the rigid resin will vary depending on the For optimum viscosity and rate of reaction adrelative liexibility desired. Generally, the amount of powdered glass used will fall within the range of about l5 to 100 parts for each 100 parts resin.\nIn place of the use of impregnated core material such as kraft paper, a non-bibulous rigid material such as masonite or plywood can be used. In this connection, the polyester resin overlay portion containing the disposed powdered glass and laminated to a colored face sheet 10 is laminated to the non-bibulous rigid material in following a modified continuous manufacturing process in forming the chalkboard. Such a product is diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 3 where the masonite base 16 is laminated with the face sheet 10 and overlay 17.\nUpon thorough testing of the chalkboards formed in the manner above described, it has been found that each product is provided with a good Writing surface of controllable color which is wear-resistant, solvent-resistant, resistant to corrosive chemicals, and non-fragile. The chalkboards are readily installed, available in continuous lengths and produceable at a moderate cost.\nObviously, many modifications and variations of the invention as hereinbefore set forth may be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, and therefore only such limitations should lbe imposed as are indicated in the appended claims.\nWe claim:\n1. A chalkboard formed from a polyester resin laminate and having a polyester resin overlay of a thickness not over 0.005 of an inch filled with reinforcing finely ground material, the exposed surface of said overlay being provided with a matte finish which is chalk-retaining while being readily eraseable, the polyester resin being the polymerization products of polyhydric alcohol esters of unsaturated dibasic acids.\n2.

RICE, BRIDGEPORT, CONNECTICUT.\nBICYCLE.\nSPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 425,390, dated April 8, 1890.\nApplication filed February 6; 1890.\ntion of the invention, such as will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same.\nMy invention has for its object to provide a simple, durable, and inexpensive driving mechanism for bicycles which shall be so con structed as to make the driving-pulley selfadjusting to compensate for changes in the resistance to forward movement of the machine-that is to say, I so construct and or- 'anize the parts that Without movement or b eifort on cally increased at the expense of a reduction in speed when ever heavy roads or inclines are met in riding. I am thus enabled to obtain a much higher rate of speed upon firm level ground than has heretofore been possible, and at the same time reduce the speed automatically and apply much greater power to hill climbing and riding upon heavy roads than has been possible with any machine heretofore produced. These results I accomplish by the use, in connection with abelt to transmit power, of a yielding self-adjusting driving-pulley.\ngist of my invention lies, broadly, in the use in this connection of a yielding driving-pu1- ley, and that the special construction of the pulley -that is, the special manner in which it is made to adjust itself to the difierent requirements of light and heavy roads-is not of the essence of my invention. I have therefore shown several diiferent constructions of pulleys, all of which accomplish the desired result in a practical and satisfactory manner.\nIn order that others may fully understand my invention and the manner of its use, I will proceed to describe the same in detail, referring by numbers to the accompanying drawings, forming part of this specification, in which- Figure 1 is a side elevation of a bicycle with my novel driving mechanism applied the part of the rider the power avaib able to drive the machine shall be automati- It should be understood that the Serial No. 339,474.

It consists of two disks,\"which are so conder certain circumstances in use, so as to permit the wedge-shaped belt to move inward, thereby lessening the actual operative diameter of the driving-pulley, which necessarily acts to reduce the speed of the machine and to greatly increase the power that the rider is able to apply to the driven axle. The driving-axle is journaled in a suitable bracket .8 upon some rigid portion of the framework of the machine.\nInthe form illustrated in Figs. 1 to 5, inclusive, the disks of which the driving-pulley is composed are preferably stamped up from heavy sheet metal, although of course the special metal used is, unimportant so far as the principles of my invention are concerned. In this form one of the disks is rigidly secured to a collar 9, which is itself rigidly secured to the driving-axle, and the other is rigidly secured to a collar 10 on a sleeve 11, which is secured to the driving-axle by a pin 12, which passes through a hole in the axle with a drive fit, and through and beyond slots 13 in opposite sides of the sleeve, so that the sleeve must at all times rotate with the axle, although the axle, the disk attached directly thereto, and the cranks are permitted to move longitudinally, under certain circumstances presently to be explained, independently of the sleeve. The sleeve is held against endwise movement by screw-threaded collars 14, which engage corresponding screw-threads upon the sleeve, the curved inclines of the ball-bearings being formed, respectively, in said sleeve and collars, as clearly shown in Fig. 4. The disks of the driving-pulley are normally held approximately in contact, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, by means of a spring 16, one end of which bears against the ends of pin 12, which extend outward beyond the sleeve and the other end against a collar 15- 011 the sleeve, said collar being threaded to engage the sleeve and being held securely in position bythe pressure of the spring. Should it berequired at any time to change the adjustment of this springt-hat is, so that more or less power would be required to separate the disks of the driving-pulleyit may be done by shifting this collar upon the sleeve.\nThe operation of this portion of my invention is as follows: It will be seen that when increased resistance to forward movement of the machine is encountered it will first affect the driven axle and will cause the belt to drag sition.\non the driving-axle. The rider at this instant will naturally apply additional power to the driving-axle and driving-pulley to overcome the resistance. The combined effect of the increase of resistance to the rotation of the driven pulley and consequent drag of the belt, and the additional power applied to the driving-pulley to overcome the resistance, will be to overcome to a greater or less extent the power of spring 16, which holds the disks on the driving-axle together, thereby causing the belt to passinward farther between the disks structed as to yield outward or separate unand lessening the actual operative diameter of the driving-disk an amount determined by the excess of power applied to the drivingdisk by the rider over the'power of spring 16.\nIt will of course be understood that this spring is so adjusted that in use under ordinary circumstances, as when running upon level ground or when the resistance is slight, the power of the spring will be quite sutlicienttoovercome the tendency of the belt to wedge the disks apart, and consequently the normal diameter of the pulley will be maintained.\nThe instant the resistance to forward movement of the machine diminishes the rider naturally exerts less power upon the cranks. The tendency, therefore, is for the belt to move outward again, which permits spring 16 to force the movable disk back to its normal po- The driving-pulley is thus made selfadjusting to the work required.\n' In practice I find no difficultyin varying the speed from forty-five to sixty inches forward movement for each' revolution of the crank. It is of course well known that ordinary Safety bicycles are speeded to fifty-four inches forward movement for each revolution of the crank, a fifty-seven-inch gearing being occasionally used. A gearing of sixty inches forward movement, and even more, has been tried. The result has been, however, that there has been such a sacrifice of power as to render it difficult to force the machine up ordi-.\nnary grades, and, on the other hand, gearings giving but fifty inches forward movement, and even less, 'have'been tried. These 'low gearings give greater power, but at such a sacrifice of speed as to render the machine unsatisfactory for general use. My improvement, however, renders the driving-pulley self-adjusting to correspond with the resist ance to be overcome. I thus with a single simple mechanism obtain greatly-increased speed, except upon grades and heavy roads,\nand greatly-increased power when resistance is met with. In the form just described the driving-shaft itself moveslaterally,carrying one of the disks with it, the hub of the crank serving as a stop to limit the movement. (See at the right in Fig. 5.)\nIn Figs. 7 and '7 I have shown a style of self-adj usting driving-pulley in which the sleeve'and spring are dispensed with, two.\nspring-disks being used in lieu of a rigid disk and a spring-actuated disk.\ntwo disks are rigidly bolted between two col- In this form the IIO lars1'7, the outer edges of the disks them-' selves springing outward-that is, separating-when the resistance to rotation of the driven axle, and the consequent drag of the belt on the driving-pulley, has caused the;\nrider to increase the power applied to drive the machine sufficiently to overcome the spring action of the disks. In Figs. 8 and 9 the two disks are preferably cast, although may be made of sheet metal, if preferred. One of the disks is provided with a hub 18, which is rigidly secured to the axle, and with brackets 19, carrying rollers 20. The other disk is provided with a circular opening 21' they of just sufficient size to receive rollers 20, so\nthat this disk will turn on said rollers independently of the axle and the other disk. The two disks are connected together by links 22, ing pivoted to the respective disks. The disks are held at their normal position by means of a spring 16, the ends of which are attached to the disks, respectively,the action being to draw them toward each other, the\nlinks turning obliquely and lying in suitable.\nsockets 23 in the disks, the normal or closed position of the disks being shown at the right in Fig. 9 and the open position at the left in said figure. In this form, when increased power is applied to the driving-pulley to overcome resistance to forward movement of the machine, the action of the belt is to crowd the loose disk away from the fixed disk. This is accomplished by rotating the loose disk slightly upon rollers against the power of spring 16, said disk being free to separate,\nprovided the strain upon the belt is great enough to overcome the power of the spring to the full length of the linksthat is, until the links lie straight across between the disks, as at the left in Fig. 9. As soon as the excess of power upon the cranks is relieved the belt will move outward again, and the spring will act to rotate the loose disk backward, and the links will fall back obliquely into the sockets 23, in which they lie.\nThe form illustrated in Fig. 10 is somewhat similar to that illustrated in Figs. 8 and 9. The spring employed in this form, and which is not shown in the drawings, is just the same as in Fig. 8. In this form the loose disk is provided with cams 24, which are adapted to slide into recesses 25 in the fixed disk when the disks are at their normal position, as at the right in Fig. 10. The cams are provided with slots 26 and pins 27, driven through the solid material of the fixed disk, and the slots in the cam limit the outward movement of the loose disk and prevent the disks from being disconnectedunder anycircumstances. The operation in this form is precisely the same as in the form last described.\n28 denotes the driven pulley, which is rigidly secured to the hub 30 of the rear wheel, which is j ournaled on an axle 29, rigidly secured in the frame -work of the machine. The driven pulleyI do not make self-adjustthe opposite ends of said links being, but preferably make it in two parts, so\nthat it may be readily adjusted. These parts are denoted, respectively, (see Fig. 6,) by 28 and 28. One of these parts (see 28) maybe made integral with the hub, as shown in the drawings, or, if preferred, may be made separate and secured thereto in any suitable manner. The outer end of the hub is screwthreaded, and the other disk (see 28 is provided with a threadedhub engaging therewith. This disk may be fixed at any desired adjustment relatively to the other disk and locked there by set-screws 3 l, passing through the hub of the rear wheel, or, if preferred, by set-screws (not shown) passing through the hub of the loose disk. This adjustment of the driven disk I use when, for any reasonas, for instance, along run upon a smooth road, or possibly in racing-it is desired to obtain even a greater amount of speed than is possible upon a smooth road with the ordinary adjustment. It will be apparent that the principle is the same as with the drivingdisk, except that when the disks'are moved apart, thereby reducing the operative diameter of the driven disk, the result is an increase in speed, instead of an increase of power, as in the former instance. It will of course be apparent that when the diameter of the driving-disk is reduced, as when overcoming increased resistance to forward movement of the machine or when the diameter of the driven disk is reduced to give increased speed, the belt will be slackened, and consequently would run loosely and lose power unless the slack was taken up. In order to take up the slack of the belt to give increased hold upon the driven pulley, and also to enable me to dispense with belt-adjusting mechanism, I provide an idler 32, carried by an arm 33, which is free to turn on the rear axle. The exact details of construction of these portions of my invention may of course be varied greatly without departing from the principle thereof.\nThe construction of my preferred form is clearly illustrated in Fig. 2, taken in connection with Fig. 6. Arm 33 is rigidly secured to a collar 34:, which turns freely on the axle, this collar being on the inner side of the side piece of the frame-work, which I have de noted specifically by 1. The idler is kept continually in contact with the belt by means of a spring 35, acting against the arm by which the idler is carried. One end of this spring in my preferred form is connected to collar 34: (see Fig. 2) and the other end to an arm 36, the inner end of which is enlarged, (see dotted lines, Fig. 2,) and is provided with an -opening through which the rear axle passes. Outside of this arm is a plate 37, which is provided at its lower end with an inwardly-turned lug 38, against which arm 33 rests, and which acts as a'stop to limit the downward movement thereof. In order to provide a ready adjustment for this stop, I provide a curved slot 39 in said plate and lock it at any desired adjustment by means of ai bolt a0, passing through the slot and engaging side piece 1 of the frame-work. I\nArm 36 and plate 37 are locked in position on the axle by the usual nut 41. Should it be desired to adjust the tension of the spring, it is simply necessary to loosen nut 41 and, move arm 36 in either direction, as may be? required. To adjust plate 37 it is necessary to loosen both nut 41 andbolt 40. The partsj are locked in position after adjustment by f tightening the nut or bolt or the bolt alone, :5 as may be. In the form shown in Fig. 7 the! stop for arm 33 is dispensed with, and the arm? and idler are held in operative position by a ooil-spring42, one end of which is connected to said arm and the other to any suitable portion of the frame-work of the machine. j,\nAs already stated, I preferably use tllQOOIl-f; struction illustrated in Figs. 2 and 6 for the} reason that the parts are inexpensive to p'roduce, the spring is wholly out of'the way, and adjustments are provided to regulate the tenj sion of the spring and the oscillation of the arm carrying the idler.\nHaving thus described my invention, I; claim 1 1. The combination, with the driven pulley} of a bicycle, of a self-adj usting two-part driving-pulley and a belt connecting said pu-lleys,f whereby when resistance to forward movement is met and power is applied to overcome it the strain of the belt upon the driving pulley will cause the parts thereof to separate and the belt to move inward, thereby reducing the operative diameter of thedriving pulley, so that the power is increased with a consequent loss of speed.\n2.

Serial No. 673,321. (No model.)\nTo all whom it may concern:\nBe it known that we, AMOS E. LONG and ALBERT A. JONES, of the city of Philadelphia, in the State of Pennsylvania, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Caps for Bottles, Jars, &c., of which the following is 'a specification, reference being had to the accompanying drawings.\nO'ur invention relates to closures for vessels designed to be used but once and is adapted to indicate by its condition whether the vessel upon which it is secured has been opened or not.\nGenerally stated, our invention comprises a cap, preferably of sheet metal, provided with resilient sheet-metal tongues, the latter being adapted to automatically engage beneath a flange or lip upon the vessel to which the cap is applied in such manner as not to be detachable therefrom except by mutilation of the latter.\nIn the accompanying drawings,'Figure 1 is a sectional view showing a convenient embodiment of our invention applied upon a bottle. Fig. 2 is a sectional view showing a modified form of our invention applied upon a jar. Fig. 3 is a side elevation of the form of our invention shown in Fig. 1'. Fig. 4 is a fragmentary sectional view of theform of our invention shown in Fig. 2.\nReferring to Fig. 1, A is the bottle, the neck A of which is provided with a lateral flange or lip A and B is the cork inserted in said neck. The cap 0, which is adapted to in close said cork and neck, is provided with resilient sheet-metal tongues 0, adapted to automatically engage beneath the flange or lip A when the cap is placed in position, as indicated in Fig. 1.\nThe neck A is preferably provided with a shoulder a, projecting beneath the cap 0 and preferably of a diameter equal thereto, the shoulder a projecting beneath the cap 0 for engagement with the lower edge thereof and said tongues 0 being seated in the recess A In the form of our invention shown in Fig. 2 the jar A is provided with a rigid cork or sto er B which ma be maintained in air- PD a tight relation with the former by means of the intermediate packing-ring b preferably of soft rubber. In the latter form the resilient tongues o of the cap O engage beneath the flange a in the manner above set forth. It is obvious that it is necessary to destroy the cap O in order to remove the stopper B As shown in the several figures, the metal tongues which serve to secure the cap in position upon the vessel-neck are in integral relation with the cap-body and may be conveniently formed as illustrated in Fig. 4, being struck up from the dotted position to the position shown in full lines therein. 7\nWe are aware that it is not broadly new to form avessel-closure of sheet metal. We believe it to be broadly new, however, to combine with such a cap as we have described means to effect its automatic engagement and prevent its removal, as herein set forth.\nAlthough we have shown our invention as applied upon bottles and jars, we do not desire to limit ourselves to such embodiments thereof. Moreover, it is obvious that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of our invention. We therefore do not desire to limit ourselves to the precise construction which we have shown and described.\nWe claim In a vessel-closure of the class described, the combination with a vessel-neck, having a continuous recess A and provided with an upper and a lower annular shoulder, of a cap provided at its continuous lower edge with integral struck-up and inwardly-bent tongues, the free extremities of which engage said upper annular shoulder, and the opposite extremities and lower edge of which engage said lower annular shoulder, substantially as set forth.\nAMOS E.

Serial No. 334.123.\nTo all whom it may concern:\nBe. it known that 1, WILLIAM TAYLOR, a subject of the King ofGreat Britain, residing at 57 Sparkenhoe street, Ize'icester, in the county of Leicester, England, engineer, have invented certain new and useful Irn rovements in Golf-Balls, of whichthe fol owing is a specification.\nThis invention relates to balls such as are used in the game of golf and hasfor its principal object to obtain better results in the flight of the ball in the direction of a sustained hanging flight giving a fiat trajectory with a'slight rising tendency particularly towards the end of the flight, than havebeen possible with balls of known types. Formerly the most common marking for such balls consisted of numerous grooves of even width intersectin each other and leaving between them iso ated polygonal portions of the spherical surface of the ball, and it has been proposed to invert this marking so that the spherical surface-of the ball consists of numerous ridges intersecting each other and inclosing isolated polygonal cavities. Another common marking consists in forming the surface with numerous separate prominenccs resembling those upon the sur face of a blackberry and named on this account the bramble pattern. The character of the marking which constitutes the present invention may be described in general terms as an inverted bramble pattern, and consists ofisolated cavities the essential features of which are. that they must be substantially circular in plan and substan tially evenly distributed, they must be shallow, and their sides, particularly at the lip of the cavity, must he steep. Stcepness of the cavity walls is essential to the hanging flight, but excessive depth besides )romoting the collection of dirt, is detrimental to length of flight by offering great resistance to the passage of the air. Consequently the cavity must be shallow and the steepness of its hood of the lip. These features are described and illustrated in'the accompanying drawings, in which Figure l is an elevation and Fig. 2 a central section of a solid ball the surface of which is marked in the im rovcd manner,\n' it being understood that tie invention is equally applicable to the cored type of ball.\nFigs. 3, 4 and 5 are enlar ed detail views illustrating various forms 0 cavities.\nThe section of the cell which is exemplified may be of the form of a sha low inverted truncated cone (Fi 3) with flat bottom, the angle inclosed %)y the walls being less than a right angle, but preferabl the bot tom is made somewhat concave ig. 5) the rentrant angle is rounded as shown at 0 (Figs. 4 and 5) and the angle between the walls at the lip of the cell made more acute so that the section of the cavity becomes prae tically semi-elliptical (Fig. 5).\nPreferably the cavities should occup'y not less than a quarter nor more than three uarters of the entire surface of the ball, an the hundredths of an inch, nor should they be of greater depth than fourteen thousandths of an inch, and in any case their depth should not exceed one-ei hth of their diameter.\nThe whole of the surface of the ball be.- twccn the cavities may be left spherical, olthe surface immediatel surrounding the cavities may be sloped inwardly to the lip which may either be left sharp as in Fig. 4 or may be rounded o[l,as in Fig. 5, and by this means frictional resistance to passage through the air is lessened without sacrificing anything of the hanging cllect of the llight.\nWhen the improved marking is applied to cored balls, the shell has; thercb given to it an added tensile strength and elasticity due to the reticular structure of its surface which tends to prevent bursting and permanent set or slacking of the shell. Further, cavities of the character described with their recntrant angles rounded oil, do not readily collect dirt, and are easily-cleaned.\nHaving thus described the nature of this invention and the best means I know of carrying the same into ractical effect, Iclaim:' l l. A golf ball wit 1 spherical surface pitted with isolated cavities oflarge surface area relatively to their depth, substantially circular in plan, with steep sides at the peripheries only of said cavities, and of a depth not exceeding onc-ei dith of their diameter.\n2.

For this purpose the spoon is provided with entrance tines on its end and with saw teeth on the sides of the spoon adjacent the entrance tines. These teeth may extend through the thickness of the spoon or they may extend partially through the spoon leaving thereon a web or blade like structure that will aid in cutting the food.\nIt is an object of this invention to provide a spoon bowl which has thereon relatively slender tines, providing space between the tines which terminate in an angular cutting section.\nThese and other advantages will appear from the following description taken in connection with the drawings in which:\nFigure 1 is a top plain view of a spoon formed in accordance with applicants invention.\nFigure 2 is a view looking at the end of the spoon on line 2--2 of Figure 1.\nFigure 3 is a view of the spoon taken on line 3-3 of Figure 1.\nFigure 4 is a slightly modified form of spoon in which the cutting teeth have no cutting blade or web.\nThe numeral l is used to designate a bowl of a spoon which has thereon a handle 2. On the end of the bowl as shown on Figure l opposite the handle 2 is a .plurality of tines 3, slender and elongated for puncturing purposes. Between the tines are spaces 4. At the bottom of each space between the tines is formed an angular cutting section 5. Adjacent the teeth 3 and on the sides of the bowl is a series of saw teeth 7, which have between them and separating them notches 9 as shown in Figure l. The notches 9 are partially cut through the spoon so that there is left a web or blade like structure 8. It will be noticed that these teeth project toward the end of the spoon in the form of saw teeth. In Figure 4 there is shown a bowl similar to that as shown in Figure 1, but in this one there are no lateral webs or blades. The teeth stand out in the form of saw teeth projecting toward the end of the spoon. In this form the teeth are indicated by the number I0, while the spaces are indicated by number 9.\nIn its application this spoon is well adapted for use in eating grapefruit. Whatever purpose the spoon is used the tines are inserted into the fruits or vegetables for the initial cutting or separating operation. After the tine end of the spoon has been inserted the spoon will manipulate so that the teeth on the edges or sides will out the particles freely so that they may be easily removed by a kind of spading action of the spoon. The tines are easily inserted into any fruit or vegetable and then the spoon is moved to complete the cutting act. These tines aid in the inserting and the initial cutting of the material to which the spoon is applied. The further cutting of the spoon may be done by manipulating the spoon so that the teeth will continue the cutting assisted by the angular cutting sections.\nThe tines 3 are angular in shape and have their lower edges sharp as indicated by the numerals 3d and 3b for cutting purposes.\nWhat I claim is:\nIn a spoon, a bowl having a handle, a plurality of elongated tapered tines integral with the bowl and positioned at the front thereof and diametrically opposite to the handle, said tines being sharpened on both edges and joined at their bases by arcuate cutting edges for initially cutting into citrus type fruit for removal of its sections, and a plurality of closely aligned cutting teeth in the form of saw teeth arranged integral with and along each lateral edge of the bowl, whereby reciprocating motion of the handle causes the teeth to fully separate fruit sections initially cut by the cutting edges of the tines.\nJACK YOLLES.\nReferences Cited in the file of this patent UNITED STATES PATENTS Number Name Date D. 58,685 Rayder Aug. 9, 1921 868,583 Schuyler Oct. 15, 1907 880,166 Ruggles Feb. 25, 1908 1,479,015 Steinman Jan. 1, 1924 1,827,780 Chambers Oct. 20, 1931 1,911,974 Shelton May 30, 1933 FOREIGN PATENTS Number Country Date 428,837 Great Britain Jan. 31, 1935"

The conveyor track between the inlet and outlet functions as a storage reservoir for the purpose of lmaintaining a supply of articles that may be fed independently in turn to onemachine regardless :of :the rate of delivery of Y,the articles from yanother machine,\nAnother object of this invention is the provision of a storage feeder bowl which provides a pair of inner and outer annular walls for supporting a descending and an ascending conveyor track for the purpose of depositing the articles in the bottom of the bowl and then picking them up and delivering them to the upper edge of the other annular wall of the bowl thereby providing a storage not only along the helical conveyor path but in the bottom ci the bowl.\nAnother object of this invention is the provision of a continuous conveyor track supported by upstanding annular wall means, which track descends and ascends to provide a storage space for receiving and delivering articles in turn consecutively and preventing them from tumbling or otherwise becoming chipped or marred while striking one another. ln this structure the track is continuous and the articles stay in line from one end to the other.\nOther objects and advantages appear herein after in the following description and claims.\nThe accompanying drawings show, for the purpose of exemplification without limiting the invention or claims thereto, certain practical ernbodiments of the invention wherein:\nFig. 1 is a view partly in section and partly in elevation showing one form of feeder bowl comprising this invention.\nFig. 2 is a plan view of Fig. l.\nFig. 3 is a View partly in vertical section and partly in elevation showing a bowl having inner and outer annular walls oi substantially the same height with the conveyor paths terminating at the bottom or\" each wall for the purpose of increasing the storage and for transferring the articles from one conveyor to the other.\nthe structure shown in `@Fi-g. 4-ls aplan viewof the structure shown in Fig. 3. f\nReferring to Figs. 1 and 2 of the drawing -the feeder storage bowl l comprises the base member'2 having the threaded Iopenings '3 for mountf ing'the same on a vibratory feeder motor.\nvThe base memberZ- has the louter upstanding annular wall il secured lto its perimeter and the inner upstanding annular wall '5 secured in its central opening 6. Thus the 'bowl member I is provided with two upstanding annular walls, which for all pratical purposes are substantially concentric to one another but may be arranged eccentrically, if-the character of the articles and theccnveyor trackfor Vpath requires sucha Vstructure.\nAs shown lthe flstoragebowl l is provided with a conveyor xpath 1 which :starts :from :the zinlet 18 with the spiral section It that passes through the upstanding wall 4 and travels downwardly in an annular helical path until it reaches the bottom or base member 2 of the bowl and thence travels across the base in a continuous spiral path as indicated at Il to the bottom of the helical path l2, thence upwardly on the outside of the inner annular wall 5 to the top thereof, as indicated at I3, which is tangent tothe helix of the conveyor track section l2 and which is slightly abovev the annular wall 5, being supported by the brackets I4 as shown in Figs. 1 and 2.\nThe articles are deposited at the intake 8 and they travel downwardly to the bottom of the bowl and then across the bottom of the bowl and upwardly to the outlet I3. The inlet i3 'and the outlet i3 are relatively close to one another, although one is higher than the other as indicated on the drawings. Thus the continuous conveyor path for the articles provides a storage by causing the articles to travel downwardly and then upwardly in their circuit through the feeder bowl.\nIn the structure shown in Figs. 3 and 4 the base member I6 has a conically shaped bowl oor I1, and the outer annular Wall i8 is secured to the base I6 and extends upwardly substantially the same distance as the inner annular wall 20. The inner annular wall 2B is provided with a downwardly extending conveyor path 2| that discharges the articles on the bottom il of the conveyor bowl and from whence the articles travel across the conical surface Il of the bowl to where they are picked up by one or more of the conveyor tracks 22 that travel up on the inside of the bowl I8, the articles being inserted in the inlet 23 and being discharged from the outlet 24. In this instance the articles are not retained in turn but may pile up or be otherwise stored in the bottom of the bowl. Such articles should be able to tumble and strike one another without injuring themselves. However, when it is desirable'that the articles not tumble or not strike or come in contact with each other, then it is preferable to use the continuous conveyor path as disclosed in Figs. 1 and 2. By making the inlet 23 and the outlet 24, 180D from each other, the storage conveyor unit as disclosed in this structure may be positioned between adjacent machines of the production line requiring that the articles travel substantially the same horizontal plane.\nWhile, for clarity of explanation, certain embodiments of this invention have'been shown and described, it is to be understood that this invention is capable of many modiiications and changes in construction and arrangement of parts, and certain parts may be employed without the conjoint use of other parts and without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.\nIclaim:\n1. A conveyor feeder bowl which comprises, base means adapted to be secured to a feeder motor, and an inner and an outer upstanding annular wall member mounted concentrically in spaced relation to each other on said base means, a helically disposed conveyor track mounted on each annular wall member, the articles traveling down one wall member across the base means and up the other annular wall member, and an inlet and an outlet for said conveyor track.\n2. A conveyor feeder bowl which comprises, base means adapted to be secured to a feeder motor, and an inner and an outer upstanding annular Wall member mounted concentrically in spaced relation to each other on said base means, a helically disposed conveyor track mounted on each annular wall member, the articles traveling down the outer face of the inner wall member across the base means and up the inner face of the outer annular wall member, and an inlet on the upper end of the conveyor track on the outer wall member and an outlet on the upper end of the conveyor track on the inner wall member.\n3. A conveyor feeder bowl which comprises, a base forming the bottom of the bowl and having means to secure it to a feeder motor, upstanding concentric cylindrical walls mounted on said base in spaced relation to each other to form the bowl therebetween, a helical conveyor track formed into a series of annular turns on each of the opposite faces of said concentric cylindri-= cal walls, each helical conveyor track for simul taneously conveying the material therealong.\n4.

Vogel, Hillside, Md.\nApplication March 3, 1952, Serial No. 274,572\n1 Claim.\nWhile the invention is here shown and described as more particularly embodied in a drinking cup, it will be understood that it is applicable also to various other types of containers for liquds and foods.\nMy invention has for its object the provision of a container that has a dead air space to give it heat-insulating properties and which may, nevertheless, be made so cheaply that it can be discarded after one use, the container also having greater mechanical strength than the paper cups and containers ordinarily found at soda fountains.\nAs shown in the accompanying drawing, Fig. 1 is a vertical sectional view through a cup embodying my invention; Fig. 2 is a partial plan view thereof; Fig. 3 is a section on the line III-III of Fig. l and Fig. 4 is a section on the line IV-IV of Fig. 1.\nThe article comprises an outer shell I of cup like from and an inner cup- like receptacle 2, the two cup-like members being spaced apart throughout the major portion of their heights, to provide a dead air space as indicated at 3. The container 2 will preferably be formed or molded of paper-like material that is waterproof and resistant to hot liquids such as cofiee and which also will not be adversely affected by iced liquids. The shell I can likewise be made of paper-like material, suitable for the printing of advertisements thereon, or designs can be formed thereon.\nThe shell i is shaped at its lower end to form a flange 4 at the juncture of its side wall and its bottom wall or lip 5.\nThe receptacle 2 is expanded somewhat near its upper end, as indicated at 6, to thereby proconnection with the shell. This rolled edge I serves also to stiffen the container.

Carroll, Berlin, Conn., assignor to The Stanley Works, New Britain, Conn., a corporation of Connecficut Continuation of abandoned application Serial No. 167,873, June 13, 1950. This application February 23, 1954, Serial No. 411,620\n1 Claim. (Cl. 16-169) This invention relates to hinges or butts of the type having a pair of leaves with interfitting knuckles provided with aligned bores, a removable pin extending downwardly through the knuckles for pvotally connecting the leaves together, and a tip or closure member permanently secured to the lower end of the bottommost knuckle and covering the bore thereof.\nIn a hinge or butt of this type, the pin or pintle, While permitting relative pivotal movement of the leaves, sometimes becornes stuck in the knuckles. In some instances, hinges of this sort are provided with means for preventing the pins from gradually working up from their seated positions upon repeated operations of the hinge. It is usually the custom to remove the pin by applying a tool to the head of the pin and then exert an upward force on the tool. For example, attempts may be made to remove the pin from the knuckles by pulling the pin upwarclly by means of a par of pliers applied to the head or upper end of the pin; or by driving the pin upwardly by applying the upper end of an inclined blade or tool to a generally downwardly facing portion of the head and striking the lower end of the tool with a hammer; or by driving the edge of a tool between the head and the upper surface of the uppermost knuckle and then using the tool as a pry or lever. In any event, with hinges of this sort, difficulty has been experienced in removing the pin when it is desired to disassemble the leaves, and in the operation of removing the pin, damage to and marring of the head thereof and the adjacent members to which the hinge leaves are connected result.\nThe object of the present invention is to provide un improved arrangement whereby the pin may be quickly, easily, and conveniently driven upwardly from its operative or seated position without any likelihood, or in faet possibility, of da.rnaging any portion of the hinge or -any portions of the members to which the hinge leaves are connected.\nOther objects Will be in part obvious and in part pointed out more in detail hereinafter.\nIn the drawing:\nFig. 1 is a side view of an open hinge, the two lower knuckles beng illustrated in longitudinal cross seetion so as to reveal the internal construction, and\nFig. 2 is an elevational view of the bottom or lower edge of the hinge.\nReferring to the drawing in detail, A and B are ordinary hinge leaves formed of sheet metal and respectvely hav ing rolled knuckles 11 and 12. The knuckles of the two leaves are interfitted so that the bores thereof are in aligned relation. The pin is designated by the letter C. Il; has, at its upper end, a head 13 the under surface of which seats against the upper end of the uppermost knuckle 12. Driven in, or otherwise permanently secured to, the lower end of the bottom knuckle 12 s a tip D which serves the usual purpose of giving a finished and pleasing appearance to the hinge. In the present illustrative disclosure, the bottom tip member is shown as having a stud portion snugly fitted in the bore of the lowermost knuckle and a head portion engaging against the lower edge of the knuckle.\nIf desired, -any sutable means may be provided for preventing the pin C from gradually working up from its seated position. Por illustrative purposes, I have shown here this means as comprising a spring ring E positioned in a groove in the pin and arranged to engage a downwardly and outwardly flared portion 14 of the lower end of the bore of the uppermost knuckle 12. An arrange ment of this sort is shown in the Morse Patent No. 2,154,860, issued April 18, 1939.\nWith the construction so far described, it is apparent that if it Were attempted, as has heretofore been necessary, to withdraw the pin from the knuckles by engaging the head of the pin with a tool, as by a pair of pliers and pulling upwardly or by means of a tool applied against the edge of the head and driving or prying upwardly, the aforementioned disadvantages and dificulties would be experienced. In accordance with the present invention and in order to avoid these and other difliculties and disadvantages, the tip D is provided with a small central bore or aperture 15 arranged to permit the insertion of a nail 16 or the like into the tip and the engagement of the upper end of the nail against the bottom end of the pin C. The nail having been so inse1ted, the pin may be forced up sufliciently to permit the head thereof to be conveniently gripped by the fingers by tapping the lower end or the head of the nail. It will thus be observed that the pin may be quickly, easily, and conveniently raised from its seat and removed without any danger of injuring the pin, marring its head, or marring or damaging the door jamb or door or the finish on the knuckleg. At the same time the aperture or bore 15 in the tip D is of relatively small diameter so that the finish or pleas ing appearance given to the hinge by the tip is in no way detracted from.\nAs many changes could be made in the above construction and many apparently widely different embodiments of this invention could be made without departing from the scope thereof, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting senso.\nIt is also to be understood that the language used in the following clairn is intended to cover all of the generic and specific features of the invention herein described and all statements of the scope of the invention which, as a matter of language, might be said to fall therebetween.\nThe present application is a continuation of my copending application, Serial No. 167,873, filed June 13, 1950, now abandoned.\nI claim:\nIn a hinge of the type compris-ing a pair of hinge leaves having a plurality of integral knuckles along one edge of each of the leaves, said knuckles being in interfitting relation and having aligned bores, a removable pintle engaged in said bores provided with a button-like head having a single downwardly facing surface in the form of a flat base engaging against the upper end of the uppermost knuckle and substantially covered by said knuckle, and means between the pintle and one of said knuckles for impeding removal of the pintle; a closure member permanently secured to the lower end of the bottommost knuckle having a stem fixed in the bore of the lowermost knuckle and a button-like head having a configuration similar to that of the head of said pintle including a single upwardly faeing surface in the form of a flat base engaging against the lower end of the lowermost knuckle, said closure member being provided with an elongated axial throughbore of smaller diameter than the pintle extending through the head and stem to receive and slidably support a nail or other pintle knockout tool of smaller bora walls.\nReferences Cited in the file of this patent UNITED STATES PATENTS John May 21, 1907 4 2,000,856 Lyons May 7, 1935 2,308,284 Ibach Jan. 12, 1943 2,455,232 Corner Nov. 30, 1948 OTHER REFERENCES Stanley Hardware Catalog 61, page 64.

MacDonald, Adrian, Mich, assignor to Cardinal of Adrian, Inc., a corporation of Michigan Original application Nov. 5, 1962, Ser. No. 235,217, new\nPatent No. 3,295,532, dated Sept. 14, 1965. Divided and this appiication Mar. 19, 1965, tier. No. 438,524\n7 Claims. (Cl. 16184) This invention relates to an improved hinge for latchless doors and more particularly to a hinge capable of urging a door toward and beyond its closed position so that the door remains securely closed without the necessity of employing a latch.\nHinges of the general nature with which the present invention is concerned are designed to keep a door tightly closed without any latch at all and are primarily used for small doors, such as for cabinets. To accomplish this, the hinge has a spring on one portion which contacts an engageable part on a second portion in such a manner that the door is urged beyond its normally-closed position. Hence, the door, when closed, is continuously urged against the door stop and a latch is not necessary. Elimination of the latch eliminates the cost of it and the cost of installation, which is often a time consuming procedure in order to align the latch components properly. Further, the latch components often become misaligned during changes in the weather, particularly during periods of high and low humidity, so that readjustment is periodically required. Misalignment also occurs during wear of the components and settlement of the building containing the door and door frame. Hinges of this nature also have the advantage of closing the door tightly without bouncing, even if it is slammed shut.\nThe latchless door hinge according to the invention has several advantages over those heretofore known. The new hinge is less expensive, having fewer components and less complicated ones. The new hinge also has increased closing power which is particularly advantageous for heavier doors, such as those for large cabinets. In addition, the hinges can be pre-assembled in order to reduce field labor rather than having to be assembled on the job site when the doors are hinged to the frames.\nIt is, therefore, a principal object of the invention to provide a latchless door hinge having the advantages outlined above.\nOther objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which:\nP16. 1 is a fragmentary plan View, with parts in cross section, of a cabinet, latchless door, and hinge embody ing the invention;\nFIG. 2 is an enlarged view in perspective of the hinge shown in FIG. 1, but in an open position;\nFIG. 3 is a plan view of the hinge shown in FIG. 2;\nFIG. 4 is a plan view of the hinge of FIGS. l3, in a closed position, with parts broken away and with parts in cross section;\nFIG. 5 is a detailed view in cross section taken along the line 5-5 of FIG. 3;\nFIG. 6 is a view similar to FIG. 1 but showing a further modified hinge;\nFIG. 7 is an enlarged view in perspective of the hinge shown in FIG. 6, but in an open position;\nFIG. 8 is a plan view of the hinge of FIG. 7, with parts broken away and with parts in section;\nFIG. 9 is a plan view of the hinge of FIGS. 6-8, in a closed position, with parts broken away and with parts in section; and\nFIG. 10 is a view in cross section taken along the line 10-10 of FIG. 7.\nReferring to FIGS. 1-5, a cabinet 68 includes side walls 70, a hinge frame member 72, and a door stop frame member 74 having a bumper 76. A door 77, of the overlay type in this instance, covers the cabinet opening and is hinged to the frame member 72 by a hinge 73 embodying the invention. The hinge 78 includes a first portion 80 and a second portion 82 pivotally connected thereto. The first portion 80 includes a back plate 84 having openings 86 to receive screws 88 which are turned into the hinge frame member 72 to affix the hinge 73 thereto. The first portion 8%) also includes an extension plate 90 having a pivot pin opening 92 (FIG. 5) at the outer end thereof to receive a pivot pin or rivet 94-. The opening 92 is larger than the pin 94 and is of non-circular shape to receive a non-circular projection 96 of a sleeve bearing 98. The bearing 98 has a flat surface rec (FIG. 4) forming an edge or engageable part 102.\nThe second portion 82 of the hinge 78 includes a back plate 104 having openings 1.06 and 108 to receive screws 11!) which are turned into the door 77 to afiix the hinge portion 32 thereto. The portion 82 also includes an extension plate 112 which extends past the upper or lower edge of the door '77, the edges being recessed for the extension 112, if desired. The extension 112 has an opening 114 near the outer end thereof to receive an end of the pivot rivet 94 which is then flared to form a permanent pivotal connection between the portions 89 and 82. The sleeve bearing 98 between the extensions 99 and 112 facilitates pivotal movement between them, the bearing 98 preferably being of a slippery plastic material such as Teflon or Delrin. The extension 112 has an upturned flange 116 along a diagonal edge thereof and an upturned retaining car 118 struck upwardly from the extension 112 and spaced from the flange 116. A spring rod 120 is held between the flange 116 and the car 118 with the free end of the rod 126 riding on the bearing 98. The bearing holds the rod 120 in a sprung position displaced from its normal or unsprung condition.\nWhen the door '77 is opened, the hinge 78 is in the position shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 with the free end of the spring rod 124) contacting the arcuate portion of the bearing 98 with the force of the spring rod 12% being directed through the pivot pin 94-. Hence, only a slight drag results and this is kept to a minimum because of the minimum friction between the rod 120 and the bearing 98.\nAs the door 77 is moved toward a closed position and forms an included angle of roughly 25 with the face of the cabinet 68, the spring rod 12% comes in contact with the part 102 of the bearing 98 and begins to exert a force to one side of the pivot pin 94 as it moves beyond a position tangential to the bearing 98 at the part 1652. The resulting torque urges the door toward the closed position and the torque remains even after the door is closed because the spring rod 12% still contacts only the part 1162, rather than the entire fiat surface 104). Hence, the force of the spring rod 1213 continues to act to one side of the pivot pin 94 and the door isurged past a closed position. The hinge 78 is preferably arranged so that the door would ordinarily move, if not restricted by the frame member 74, to a position approximately 3 (FIG. 4) beyond the closed position, although any angle from 2 to at least 10 is suitable.\nFrom the above discussion and description, it will be seen that the hinge is relatively uncomplicated and can be produced quite inexpensively. Further, the spring rod can be of almost any suitable size so as to produce a wide variation in force upon the engageable edge of the hinge member. It may also be noted that the spring can be fully assembled during the manufacture of the hinge so that the only field labor involved is attaching the back plate of the one hinge portion to the frame member and attaching the plate of the other hinge portion to the door.\nReferring to the modification of FIGS. 6-9, a cabinet 122 includes side walls 124, a hinge frame member 126, and a door stop frame member 128 having a door bumper 130. A door 132 again is of the overlay type and is pivotally attached to the hinge frame member 126 by a hinge 134. The hinge 134 includes a first portion 136 and a second portion 138 which are pivotally connected. The first portion 136 includes a back plate 140' having openings 142 to receive screws 144 for fastening the portion 136 to the inner surface of the frame member 126, in this instance. The back plate 140 also forms a groove 146 (FIG. which receives a spring rod 148 having a loop 150 affixed to the plate 14%) by a rivet 152. The groove 146 enables the rod 148 to be flush with the back surface of the plate 140 so that the plate 140 can fit flush against the hinge frame member 126. The back plate 140 also has an out-turned flange 154, part of which is bent outwardly to provide a plate extension 156. The end of the extension 156 has an opening 158 (FIG. 8) which receives a pivot rivet 161) similar to the rivet 94.\nThe hinge portion 138 includes a back plate 162 having elongate openings 164 to receive screws 166 to affix the back plate 162 to the inner surface of the door 132. The plate 162 also has an extension 168 bent therefrom with an opening 176 (FIG. 9) to receive a non-circular projection 172 of a sleeve bearing 174 to prevent rotation of the bearing 174 relative to the hinge portion 138. The bearing 174 lies between the extensions 156 and 168; it also is of an oily plastic material and has a flat surface 176 and an edge or engageable part 178. The spring rod 148 extends beyond the back plate 140 and is bent to one side so that it bears against the bearing 174 at all times and the bearing 174 holds it in a sprung position displaced from its normal or unsprung position.\nWhen the door 132 is open, as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the spring rod 148 contacts the arcu-ate surface of the bearing 174 and has no appreciable effect on the opening and closing of the door. However, when the door is moved toward the closed position and reaches an angle of roughly 25 30 to the front plane of the cabinet 122, the spring rod 148 contacts the part 178 of the bearing 174. As the outer portion of the spring rod 148 moves beyond a position tangential to the bearing 174 at the part 178, the force of the spring rod is directed to one side of the pivot pin 160, thereby producing a torque tending to move the door 132 beyond the closed position. Again, this force would be exerted until the door would reach a position about 3 beyond,\nthe closed one, with a position anywhere from 2 to at least 10 beyond the closed position being satisfactory.\nVarious modifications of the above described embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and it is to be understood that such modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention, if they are within the spirit and the tenor of the depending claims.\nI claim: p\n1.

    "description": "Jan. 14 1969 A. l. w. FRANK CUP AND LID Filed April 26, 1967 ALAN l W FRANK IBNYVENTOR Hl$ ATTORNEY United States Patent Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE A cup and lid combination comprising a generally circular open-topped cup of resilient plastic material which cup adjacent its open top is generally conical with maximum transverse dimension at the open top and a lid of frangible material having a plug portion adapted to be forced down into the open top of the cup to tightly sealingly engage the inside surface of the cup and in so doing depress the resilient plastic material of the cup so that at least a part of the plug portion of the lid substantially interlocks with the cup, the lid having a hood portion embracing the cup rim and terminating outwardly of and below the cup rim with a tab projecting from the outer terminal edge of the hood portion which tab when pulled upwardly tears the material of the lid at opposite sides of the tab at least to the top of the hood portion, loosening the engagement between the cup and the lid, whereafter continued pulling upwardly of the tab removes the lid from the cup. The outer extremity of the hood portion of the lid constitutes a skirt extending generally downwardly but somewhat outwardly away from the cup with the tab projecting from the terminal edge of the skirt. The tab initially lies generally in a plane normal to the axis of the cup and lid. The lid has a generally centrally located upward projection or dome containing a vent hole, such upward projection being of irregular outline promoting damping of waves at the surface of liquid in the cup when the liquid-filled cup is being carried with consequent minimization of sloshing of liquid out through the vent hole. Such minimization of sloshing is further enhanced by proportioning the upward projection so that its depth is less than 2 /z% of the diameter of the lid and its maximum transverse dimension is less than of the diameter of the lid.\nThis invention relates to a cup and lid combination in which the lid tightly sealingly engages the cup so as to substantially interlock with the cup, the lid being provided with novel means for loosening the engagement between the cup and lid and facilitating removal of the lid from the cup. The invention also relates to a cup lid having an upward projection or dome containing a vent hole, such projection being of novel shape and dimensions minimizing sloshing of liquid out through the vent hole when a cup filled with liquid to which the lid is applied is being carried.\nWhile my invention is adaptable to cups and lids made of a variety of materials, I have found it to have exceptional utility when embodied in cups and lids of plastic material, especially when the cups are made of expandable polystyrene beads. The cups may be formed in a manner known to those skilled in the art by subjecting to heat and pressure expandable polystyrene beads impregnated with a blowing agent which under the application of heat causes the beads to expand. Cups thus formed are sufliciently deformable that When a cap is tightly applied an interlocking sealing engagement between cup and lid is produced. The lid is preferably made of relatively stiff but frangible plastic material and is provided with a tab which when pulled tears in controlled manner the ma- 'ice terial of the lid loosening its engagement with the cup and facilitating its removal.\nI provide a cup and lid combination comprising a generally circular open-topped cup of resilient plastic material which cup adjacent its open top is generally conical with maximum transverse dimension at the open top and a lid of frangible material having a plug portion adapted to be forced down into the open top of the cup to tightlysealingly engage the inside surface of the cup and in so doing depress the resilient plastic material of the cup so that at least a part of the plug portion of the lid substantially interlocks with the cup, the lid having a hood portion embracing the cup rim and terminating outwardly of and below the cup rim with a tab projecting from the outer terminal edge of the hood portion which tab when pulled upwardly tears the material of the lid at opposite sides of the tab at least to the top of the hood portion, loosening the engagement between the cup and the lid, whereafter continued pulling upwardly of the tab removes the lid from the cup. The outer extremity of the hood portion of the lid constitutes a skirt extending generally downwardly but somewhat outwardly away from the cup with the tab projecting from the terminal edge of the skirt. When the lid is applied to the cup the tab may lie generally in a plane normal to the axis of the cup and lid.\nI further provide a cup lid having a portion adapted to seal to a cup and a transverse body portion having a generally centrally located upward projection or dome containing a vent hole, such upward projection being of irregular outline promoting damping of waves at the surface of liquid in the cup when the liquid-filled cup is being carried with consequent minimization of sloshing of liquid out through the vent hole. The depth of the upward projection should be less than 2 /z% of the diameter of the lid and the maximum transverse dimension of the upward projection should be less than 15% of the diameter of the lid.\nOther details, objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent as the following description of a 4 present preferred embodiment thereof proceeds.\nIn the accompanying drawings I have shown a present preferred embodiment of the invention in which FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of a cup and lid combination in accordance with my invention;\nFIGURE 2 is a top plan view of the cup and lid combination shown in FIGURE 1;\nFIGURE 3 is a fragmentary view largely in central vertical cross-section 0n the line III-III of FIGURE 2 of the upper portion of my cup and lid combination;\nFIGURE 4 is an enlarged fragmentary perspective view of my cup and lid combination illustrating the first step in removal of the lid from the cup;\nFIGURE 5 is a fragmentary side elevational view of the cup and lid combination as shown in FIGURE 4;\nFIGURE 6 is a view similar to FIGURE 5 but showing the lid removed from the cup; and\nFIGURE 7 is an enlarged fragmentary cross-sectional view illustrating the interlocking relationship between the cup and lid when the lid is applied to the cup.\nReferring now more particularly to the drawings, there is shown a cup designated generally :by reference numeral 2 to which is applied a lid designated generally by reference numeral 3. In the form shown the cup is of circular frusto-conical form with a closed bottom and an open top, the cup being made of expandable polystyrene beads impregnated with a blowing agent as above described. The cup adjacent its open top is generally conical with maximum transverse dimension at the open top. The lid 3 is of relatively stiff but frangible plastic material. It has a plug portion 4 adapted to be forced down into the 3 open top of the cup to tightly sealingly engage the inside surface of the cup and in so doing depress the resilient plastic material of the cup so that at least a part of the plug portion of the lid substantially interlocks with the cup as shown at 5 in FIGURE 7. The lid has a hood portion 6 embracing the cup rim and exterminating outwardly of and below the cup rim. The outer extremity of the hood portion 6 of the lid constitutes a skirt extending generally downwardly but somewhat outwardly away from the cup with a tab 7 projecting from the terminal edge of the skirt. When the lid is applied to the cup the tab initially lies generally in a plane normal to the axis of the cup and lid.\nWhen the tab is pulled upwardly as illustrated in FIGURES 4 and 5 the material of the lid at opposite sides of the tab is torn in controlled manner as illustrated at 8 in FIGURE 4, such tearing extending at least to the top of the hood portion and normally terminating at that point as shown at 9 in FIGURE 4. Such tearing of the material of the lid loosens the engagement between the cup and the lid. Thereafter continued pulling upwardly of the tab removes the lid from the cup as illustrated in FIGURE 6. The tab normally remains connected with the lid along a line substantially at the top of the hood portion so that after tearing of the material of the lid as above described and illustrated in FIGURE 4 continued pulling upwardly of the tab causes the tab to somewhat change its orientation relatively to the lid as illustrated by comparison of FIGURES 5 and 6 and the lid separates from the cup.\nCentrally of the lid 3 is an upward projection 11 containing a vent hole 12. The upward projecttion 11 is of irregular outline promoting damping of waves at the surface of liquid in the cup when the liquid-filled cup is being carried with consequent minimization of sloshing of liquid out through the vent hole. In the form shown the upward projection or dome is in the form of the figure 6 which maybe an indication of the size of the lid and of the cup to which the lid may be applied. The irregular outline of the upward projection or dome interferes with or breaks up the wave action created when a cup full of liquid is being carried and importantly reduces sloshing of liquid out through the vent hole.\nThe upward projection or dome 11 is also dimensioned to further enhance the characteristic of the lid of minimizing sloshing of liquid out through th event hole. I have found that its depth should be less than 2 of the diameter of the lid. Also its maximum transverse dimension should be less that 15% of the diameter of the lid. Each of these factors contributes to minimization of sloshing of liquid out through the vent hole when a cup filled with liquid is being carried but optimum results accrue from the combination of the irregular outline of the upward projection or dome and the proportions above stated.\nMy cup and lid combination tightly confines the contents of the cup yet due to my novel lid construction the lid may easily be removed from the cup and sloshing of contents of the cup through the vent hole is minimized.\nWhile I have shown and described a present preferred embodiment of the invention it is to be distinctly understood that the invention is not limited thereto but may be otherwise variously embodied within the scope of the following claims.\nI claim:\n1. A cup and lid combination comprising a generally circular open-topped cup of resilient plastic material which cup adjacent its open top has a generally conical inside surface with maximum transverse dimension at the open top and a lid of frangible material having a plug portion adapted to be forced down into the open top of the cup to tightly sealingly engage the inside surface of the cup and in so doing depress the resilient plastic material of the cup so that at least a part of the plug portion of the lid substantially interlocks with the cup, the lid having a hood portion embracing the cup rim and terminating outwardly of and \"below the cup rim with a tab projecting from the outer terminal edge of the hood portion which tab when pulled upwardly tears the material of the lid at opposite sides of the tab a least to the top of the hood portion, loosening the engagement between the cup and the lid, whereafter continued pulling upwardly of the tab removes the lid from the cup.\n2.

    "description": "Feb. 25, 1969 A P|RRELLO ET AL 3,429,423\nVIBRATORY BOWL Filed Aug. 25, 1967 7 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE This invention relates to a vibratory feed bowl apparatus adapted to feed chopped glass fibers and a powdered material at a -uniform rate to separate conveyor means. The vibratory feed bowl apparatus consists of an inner feed bowl wherein the powdered material is stored and a concentric outer feed bowl wherein the chopped glass fibers are stored. The upstanding cylindrical wall separating the inner and the outer bowl has a spiral helical track on the inner surface thereof which feeds the powdered material at a uniform rate and a spiral helical track on the outer surface which feeds the'chopped glass fibers at a uniform rate in a free-owing manner.\nThis invention relates to a vibratory feed bowl apparatus, and more particularly to a vibratory feeder bowl apparatus wherein a plurality of materials including chopped glass fibers and a powdered material are fed at a uniform rate to separate conveyor means.\nIn conventional manufacturing practice of glass fiber reinforced resins, it is often desirable to mix chopped glass fibers with a free-fiowing powdered material such as polystyrene prior to adding the fiber mixture to a screw-type extruder. In order to do this effectively, the chopped glass fibers and the polystyrene powder should be fed into the extruder in a free-flowing condition and at a controlled uniform rate. Conventional vibratory feeders of the type to `which the present invention relate comprise feeding bowls which are mounted on or otherwise connected to a vibration creating mechanism. A helical track is formed along the inner periphery of the bowl and leads from the bottom of the bowl to an exit port at the top of the bowl. The material is placed in the bottom of the bowl and the free-flowing powdered material is driven upward on the track by the vibration.\nVibratory `bowls of the type described do not function satisfactorily with chopped glass fibers due to the tendency of glass fibers to build up a fiber mass large enough to stop the upward fiow of the glass fiber on the track. The chopped glass fibers form a stationary fiber mass in the conventional vibratory bowl because of the formation of a stationary chopped glass fiber mass is caused by the centrifugal forces at work during the operation of a vibratory feeding apparatus. The centrifugal forces cause the chopped glass fibers to gradually move outwardly toward the wall of the bowl. Since the wall prevents all further outward movement, in time sutiicient glass fibers pile up near the wall to form a mass that is interlocked to such an extent that the vibrational forces are no longer effective in moving the liber mass near the wall up the track. Once the fiber mass build-up begins, the size of the mass grows as more glass fibers move up the track and reach the congested area. Prior to this invention, vibratory bowl feeders did not satisfactorily move chopped glass fibers in a continuous freefiowing stream from the bottom of the bowl to the receiving means at the top of the bowl for any considerable length of time.\nAccurate control of feeding chopped glass at a uniform rate has been heretofore this invention a problem in nited States atem ICC making chopped glass fiber-powder mixtures. Previous methods which require individual control of both the chopped glass and the powder material feed rates were very sensitive to small changes in the feed rate of either component there-by making accurate control difficult. It has also been a problem to deliver a sufiicient quantity of chopped glass fiber in a feeding apparatus to form a high chopped glass fiber to powdered material ratio for manufacturing processes.\nIt is the primary object of this invention to provide a vibratory feeder which feeds chopped glass fibers continuously in a free-flowing manner at a uniform rate to the receiving means. It is another object of this invention to provide a single vibratory feeder wherein chopped glass fibers and a powdered material can be fed simultaneously into separate conveyor means. It is still another object of this invention to provide an improved vibratory feeder wherein chopped glass fibers and a powdered material can be fed simultaneously into separate conveyor means at a controlled ratio and at a controlled rate. It is yet another object of this invention to provide an improved vibratory feeder device wherein the chopped glass fibers can be fed at a sufficiently high rate together with a powdered material so that a high chopped glass fiber-to-powdered material ratio can be obtained.\nThese and other obpects are accomplished by a multiple bowl vibratory feeder having an outer feed bowl concentrically mounted about an inner feed bowl. The two vibrating bowls are separated by an upstanding cylindrical lwall. The cylindrical wall lhas an upwardly extending spiral trackway on the inner surface thereof adapted to carry powdered material from the inner bowl upwardly to conveyor means located at the top thereof. The cylindirical wall has an upwardly extending spiral trackway on the outer surface thereof adapted to carry chopped glass fibers from the outer bowl upwardly to separate receiving means located thereabove. During the operation of the vibratory feeder the chopped glass fibers move up the spiral trackway on the outer surface of the cylindrical walls in a free-fiowing manner. The chopped glass fibers do not pile up in a mass sufficient to stop the free-iiowing movement lthereof at the outer edge of the spiral track since as these chopped fibers pile up at the outea edge, they fall over the edge of the track which has a low retaining wall back into the bottom of the ibowl. By preventing the chopped glass fibers from building up to a level which causes a stationary mass, a free-flowing and uniform movement of the chopped glass fibers is insured. The vibratory forces drive an excess of chopped glass fibers and a powdered material to the top of the spiral tracks. At the top of the spiral tracks adjustable baffle means ldivert the excess chopped glass fibers back into the outer bowl and the excess powdered material back into the inner bowl so that only the desired quantities of each are delivered at a uniform rate to the separate conveyor means.\nOther objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description, reference being maide to the accompanying drawings wherein the preferred embodiment of this invention is shown.\nIn the drawings:\nFIGURE 1 is a side view of the vibratory feeder bowl apparatus partly in cross section and partly in elevation; and\nFIGURE 2 is an end view of the vibratory feeder bowl apparatus.\nReferring now to FIGURE l, a conventional vibrator 10 `which can be driven electrically or mechanically is supported on a base 12` that together with the vibrator 10 forms the vibrating mechanism. A commercially available vibrator unit, Syntron EB-3, works satisfactorily as the vibrator 10. Other vibratory units which are larger or smaller may be used depending upon the quantity of material which is to be moved. The bottom 14 of a cylindrical shaped outer feed bowl 16 is flxcdly secured to the upper plate 17 of the IVibrator 10 by conventional means, such as welding. An inner feed bowl 18 is concentrically mounted within the outer feed Ibowl 16. The oylindrical wall 20 of the inner feed bowl 18 is ilxedly secured to the bottom 14 of the outer feed bowl 16 by con-yentional means, such :as welding. In this manner actuation of the vibration mechanism causes similar vibration of the inner feed bowl 18 and the outer feed Ibowl 16.\nA spiral trackway 22 on the inner surface of the upstanding cylindrical lwall 20 extends upwardly from the bottom 21 of the inner feed bowl 18 to an exit port 24 at the top of wall 20. Conveyor means 26 in the form of a track extension or the like is connected to the spiral trackway 22 at the exit port 24. As shown in FIGURE 2, a baille member 28 is associated with the trackway 22 at exit port 24 to displace the excess powdered material. The baille member 28 directs the excess powdered lmaterial to fall from the trackway 22 to the bottom 21 of the inner feed bowl 18. The spiral track 22 has a retaining wall 30 in the form of a vertical flange at the outer edge thereof. The height of the retaining wall 30 and the width of the track 22 determine the quantity of the powdered material which is conveyed up to the Ibaffle member 28. The height of the - wall 30 and the width of the track 22 are not critical. The wider the track 22 and the higher the wall 30, the larger the quantity of powdered material that is conveyed upward.\nA spiral trackway 32 on the outer surface of the upstanding cylindrical wall 20 extends upwardly from the bottom 14 of the outer feed bowl 16 to an exit port 34 near the top of the wall 20. Conveyor means 36 in the form of a track extension or the like is connected to the spiral trackway 32 at the exit port 34. A baille member 37 is associated with the tracleway 32 at the exit port 34 to displace the excess chopped glass fibers. The baflle member 37 directs the excess chopped glass fibers to fall from the trackway 32 to the bottom 14 of the outer feed bowl 16. Spiral trackway 32 has a vertical retaining member 38 in the form of a vertical ilange. The width of the track 32 and the height of the vertical retaining member 38 determines the quantity of chopped glass fibers which is conveyed up to the baille member 37. The width of the track 32 is not critical. In the prefenred embodiment the iwidth of the trackway 32 is about 2 to 3 inches. The height of tlhe vertical flange 38 is critical since it prevents the fibers from building up to a level at which the fibers would no longer move up the track in a free-flowing movement. Chopped glass fibers which reach a certain height are no longer moved by vibration and tend to cause the Yfibers at a lower level to build up and block the trackway. rllhe height of the vertical flange 38 ranges from about 1A to 3%; inch. Heights of the flange 38 higher than 5X1 inch are not desirable because the chopped fiber mass has a tendency to back up and stop moving upward on the track. In addition to not ilowing freely, chopped glass masses of this size are not readily mixable with other powdered materials since this mass has a tendency to remain in a clump. Experiments show that chopped glass fibers lmove in a free-flowing state up a track 2 inches wide having a vertical retaining member 3/8 of :an inch high. Similar desirable results are obtained on a track 3 inches wide where the vertical retaining member is 3/4 of an inch high.\nIn operation, a quantity of chopped glass fibers is placed in the outer bowl 16 and a quantity of powdered material such as polystyrene powder is placed in the inner bowl 18. Activation of the vibrator 10 causes the powdered material to move up the spiral trackway 22 from the bottom of the inner bowl 18 to the top of the cylindrical rwall 20 in a conventional manner. The width of the track 22 and the height of the vertical flange 30 are designed so that an excess of powdered material is delivered to the baille member 2S which diverts the excess of the powdered material off of the track so that it falls to the bottom of the inner bowl 18. The desired quantity of powdered material passes through the exit port 24 to the conveyor means 26.\nActivation of the vibrator 10 causes the chopped glass fibers to move from the bottom of the outer bowl 16 up the spiral trackway 32 up to baille member 37. As the chopped glass fibers move on the trackway 32 they have a tendency to move outwardly on the trackway 32 toward the retaining member 38 and the height of the chopped glass fiber as a result is higher near the flange 38 than elsewhere on the track. Chopped glass 4fibers which reach a height somewhat higher than that of the flange move over the top of the flange 38 and fall back to the bottom of the outer bowl 16. The chopped glass fibers must be placed on the outer bowl 16 and driven up the spiral trackway 32 which is mounted on the outer surface of the cylindrical walls so that the height of the chopped glass fibers does not reach a level which Iwould cause the bers to block up and stop moving in a free-flowing state.\nIt has been observed that the use of the inner bowl 18 -with the spiral track 22 mounted on the inner surface of the cylindrical wall is not suitable for the practice of this invention since in this case the chopped glass fibers tend to move toward the cylindrical wall until a glass liber height is reached which causes the free-flowing movement of the chopped glass fibers to stop.\nThe width of the track 32 is designed so that an excess of chopped glass bers is delivered to the baille member 37 which diverts the excess of the chopped glass fibers off of the track so that it falls to the bottom of the outer bowl 16. The desired quantity of chopped glass fibers passes through the exit port 34 to the conveyor means 36.\nThis vibratory bowl apparatus is particularly Well suited for forming chopped glass fiber-polymer powder mixtures containing up to 40 weight percent glass. The use of this vibratory feeder in a method for preparing chopped glass ber-polystyrene molded parts is fully described in copending patent application Ser. No. 663,334.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1.

Fishburne, Jr. [33] Germany [311 P1782 372.2\nABSTRACT: A flint feed and replacement means for a pocket [54] ggfj gt jf lighter features a slide backed up by a relatively constant tenn g sion spring. The flint is clamped endwise between the slide and 431/276 the periphery of the rotary flint wheel. The slide is retractable F23q 1/06 to allow easy removal and replacement of the flint and is Field of Search 431/254, latched in the retracted position by a cooperating detent ele- 273-277 ment on the spring-loaded lid of the lighter.\na l-- j 5-5 l l r r- 9 a e \\ l 5 4 POCKET LIGHTER It is well known in pocket cigarette lighters to press the igniting flint against the flint wheel by utilizing the force of a helical spring whose tension can be preloaded and adjusted by a coaxial setscrew. By removing the small screw and the spring, flint replacement is made possible. An important disadvantage of this conventional arrangement is that the coil spring is not capable of exerting a relatively constant force on the flint as variations in spring loading due to gradual wearing of the flint take place. That is to say, when a new flint is employed, the coil spring will be rather fully compressed and will exert a considerable force against the flint. When the flint is worn and the spring expands, its tension and force drop considerably and this in turn results in poor sparking and poor lighting results. If the spring tension is increased by turning the screw to compensate for the worn flint, this inevitably will cause overloading of the spring when used with an unworn flint, so that the flint wheel can only be turned with difficulty or not at all and still further adjustment of the screw must be made. Ordinarily, the spring must be arranged horizontally and is extremely short because of the mechanical layout of the lighter, which in turn is a reason for the great variation in force between an unworn flint and a worn flint backed up by the coil spring. Also, when the adjusting screw is removed for replacement of the flint, the small coil spring has a tendency to pop out and to become lost.\nThe objective of this invention is to eliminate all of the above prior art problems by the provision of a much more efflcient and convenient flint-loading mechanism in a pocket lighter. The mechanism employs a form of spring which is capable of exerting a relatively constant force on the flint regardless of whether the flint is worn or unworn and the need for the tension-adjusting screw is completely eliminated. The mechanism also embodies a simple slide backed up by the constant tension spring, and the slide abuts one end of the flint and presses the opposite end of the flint against the flint wheel. Manual retraction of the slide permits easy replacement of the worn flint without the necessity for any flint spring adjustment. The slide and the pivoted spring-loaded lid of the lighter have cooperating latch parts which hold the slide in the retracted position until the lid is closed. Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent during the course of the following description.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING FIGURES FIG. 1 is a fragmentary vertical section through a pocket lighter with the lid closed and a spring-loaded flint inserted in the normal position, conventional parts being omitted for simplicity.\nFIG. 2 is a similar sectional view of the lighter with the lid open and the flint-engaging slide retracted and latched, the flint being shown in a partly inserted position.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring to the drawings in detail wherein like numerals designate like parts, the numeral 1 designates the body or housing of a lighter having a lid 3 hinged thereto on a cross pin 2 near the top of the lighter and in the housing. From the lid 3, an arm extension 4 projects inwardly, at the end of which an integral detent or latching lug 5 is provided, as shown.\nThe arm extension 4 possesses a journal 6 moving therewith which is engaged by the forked end of a telescopic spring housing 7 shown in broken lines containing a compressible lid The flint 13 is normally disposed horizontally with one end thereof bearing frictionally against the periphery of the flint wheel II and its other end abutting a lug l5 ofa reciprocatory slide I6 having a downward extension or foot 17 which engages and is guided by horizontal housing shoulders 18 in its movement. The upper broader head of the slide 16 engages and is guided by a top plane surface 19 of the housing. The head of the slide 16 possesses a forward thumb rest 20, to the rear of which a latching lug 21 or detent part extends downwardly, as shown, for a purpose to be described.\nCentrally within the housing 1, a torsion spring 23 has its coils supported on a fixed pin 22 and this spring is provided with one straight arm 24 bearing against a fixed pin 26 in the housing and an angled arm 25 whose terminal end engages in a locating groove 27 formed in the rear vertical wall of the slide 16. The type of spring employed is capable of exerting a nearly constant pressure against the flint l3 regardless of the length of the flint as wear occurs. That is to say, there is very little difference between the spring pressure exerted on an unworn flint as compared to a worn flint needing replacement. This eliminates the necessity for a spring tension adjustment and renders the flint wheel easy to operate at all times. When the lid 3 is closed, as in FIG. 1, the spring arm 25 continually urges the slide 16 into clamping engagement with the flint 13 and holds it firmly in contact with the flint wheel 11 with a substantially constant or even force which does not vary appreciably when the flint wears, as stated.\nWhen it is desired to replace the worn flint 13, the lid 3 is opened, as in FIG. 2, and the coil spring 8 will then bias the lid in the open position, as the journal 6 swings to the other side of the hinge or pivot element 2. The slide 16 is now retracted from the flint by placing the finger on the thumb rest 20 and the latching lug 21 of the slide will engage and lock behind the lug 5, as shown in FIG. 2, slightly above the pin 2. The spring 8 will yield slightly to permit this interlocking engagement of the detent means.

The hinge includes a first hinge leaf attached-to the door and a second hinge leaf attached to the wall of the cabinet. The second leaf includes a generally planar rearward portion which lies against the side of the cabinet wall and provides a pair of attaching tabs which are inserted into perforated shelf-support strips carried by the wall. The forward portion of the second hinge leaf is generally L-shaped and includes an intermediate portion which lies against the front of the cabinet wall. The front of the wall is provided with a vertically extending slot, and a rearwardly extending projection on the forward portion is received by the slot.\nsum 1 OF 2 FIG. 10\nINV Hammond A. Berry Michael J. Duly i BY au/rzmv, JJZbn/ 7 1K and 2 ATTORNEYS ENT( )RS CABINET HINGE BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY A particular cabinet may at times be used with doors to close the front thereof, and at other times it may be desirable to remove the doors toexpose the shelves of the cabinets. Accordingly, it is desirable that the doors be readily attachable to and removable from the cabinet. When the doors are used, they should be securely supported by the cabinet, and when the doors are removed, no unsightly screw holes or other defects in the cabinet walls should be visible.\nThe inventive hinge quickly and easily attaches a door to a cabinet wall without requiring unsightly screw holes or the like which would be visible when the door is removed. One of the hinge leaves is secured to the door, and the other leaf is firmly attached to the cabinet wall by tabs which are received in the openings of a perforated shelf-support strip attached to the wall and by a projection which is received by a decorative slot provided in the front of the wall. The second leaf is held squarely against the cabinet wall, providing a secure attachment of the door to the cabinet. The hinge may be readily disengaged from the'cabinet wall merely by prying the tabs from the perforated strip.\n1 DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a typical cabinet with several adjustable shelves;\nFIG. 2 shows the cabinet of FIG. 1 with doors attached;\nFIG. 3 is an enlarged fragmentary perspective view of one of the cabinet hinges shown in FIG. 2;\nFIG. 4 is a fragmentary sectional view taken along the line 4-4 of FIG. 3;\nFIG. 5 is a view similar to FIG; 4 with the doors swung open 180;\nFIG. 6 is a view similar to FIGS. 4 and 5 with the door swung open 180;\nFIG. 7 is a fragmentary sectional view of the center panel of a double cabinet with the left door closed and the right door swung open I80;\nFIG. 8 is a fragmentary perspective view looking into the cabinet with the doors open 180\";\nFIG. 9 is a vertical sectional view of the rearward portion of the hinge;\nFIG. 10 is a perspective view of the hinge;\nFIG. 11 is a top view showing the hinge attached to the cabinet with the cabinet wall partially broken away;\nFIG. 12 is a fragmentary perspective view similar to FIG. 8 of a modified hinge;\nFIG. 13 is a perspective view of the hinge of FIG. 12;\nFIG. 14 is a top view of the hinge of FIG. 12; FIG. 15 is a top view similar to FIG. 14 of another modification of the hinge;\nFIG. 16 is a fragmentary perspective view of the hinge illustrated in FIG. 15; and\nFIG. 17 is a perspective view of the hinge illustrated in FIG. 16.\nDESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENT Referring to FIG. 1, the numeral 20 designates generally a cabinet having right and left sidewalls 21 and 22, respectively, and several shelves 23. The shelves 23 are supported by conventional perforated shelf- support strips 24 which are attached to the sidewalls 21 and 22, and the height of the shelves 23 may be adjusted in the usual manner by changing the position of the shelves with respect to the vertically extending strips 24. Referring to FIG. 2, the cabinet 20 may be provided with right and left hand doors 25 and 26, respectively, and each door is attached to the cabinet by a pair of hinges 27.\nAs can be seen best in FIGS. 3 and 8, the cabinet wall 22 includes an outer side 28, an inner side 29, and a front side 30. The front side is provided with a vertically extending slot or groove 31 which is generally Ushaped to provide a pair of forwardly extending, spaced- apart ribs 32.\nThe inner side 29 of the cabinet wall 22 may be recessed as at 33 (FIGS. 4 and 8) so that the generally channel-shaped shelf- support strip 24 may be attached to the cabinet wall to lie flush with the inner side 29. As is well known, the conventional shelf support strips 24 are provided with spaced-apart perforations or slots 34 which receive suitable brackets to support the shelves.\nThe hinge 27 includes a pair of hinge leaves 35 and 36 and a barrel 37. Referring to FIG. 10, hinge leaf 36 includes two spaced barrel segments 37a which are interleaved with spaced barrel segments 37b on the leaf 35, and the leaves are rotatably joined by a conventional hinge bolt which passes through the barrel segments. The top and! bottom of the barrel 37 are rounded as at 33 to reduce the chance of the hinge snagging on clothes or the like.\nThe hinge leaf 36 includes a generally rectangular and planar rearward portion 39 and a forward portion 40 which is generally L-shaped in horizontal cross section. The rearward portion 39 extends along the inner side 29 of the cabinet wall and is held thereagainst by attaching tabs 41 which project generally perpendicularly from the rearward portion and are received by the perforations 34 of the shelf-support strip. The L-shaped forward portion 40 includes an intermediate portion 42 which extends generally perpendicularly from the rearward portion 39 across the front of one of the ribs 32 of the cabinet wall, and an end portion 43 which extends forwardly from the intermediate portion generally parallel with the rearward portion 39. The end portion 43 is laterally offset from the rearward portion 39 by the intermediate portion 42 a distance approximately equal to the thickness of the rib 32, and a projection or tongue 44 is punched out of the end portion 43 and bent rearwardly into the groove 31. The tongue 44 extends rearwardly generally parallel with the rearward portion 39, and the distance between the tongue 44 and rearward portion e 39 is approximately equal to the thickness of the rib 32. The\nlength of the tongue 44 in the vertical direction is approximately half of the total vertical dimension of the hinge, and the tongue provides a substantial gripping surface against the rib 32.\nThe hinge leaf 35 is attached to the side edge 45 of the door 26 in the conventional manner. The leaf 35 is provided with three countersunk holes for flat or oval head screws 46 which secure the leaf to the door. If desired, the rearward portion 39 of the leaf 36 may be provided with a countersunk opening or slot 47 aligned with the attaching tabs 41 to receive a screw 48 to hold the hinge even more securely against the cabinet wall. The screw 48 may be threaded either into one of the perforations 34 or into a screw hole 49 provided in the shelf-support strip between a pair of adjacent perforations.\nAs can be seen best in FIG. 9, the attaching tabs 41 extend generally transversely from the rearward portion 39 and are generally arcuately shaped to curve away from each other. Each of the arcuate tabs provides a valley or groove 41a adjacent the rearward portion 39 and curve toward each other at 4112. The distance between the grooves 41a of the upper and lower attaching tabs is greater than the distance between the curved portions 41b and corresponds to the minimum distance between five of the perforations 34 and the shelf-support strip. When the attaching tabs 41 are inserted into the perforations, the rounded portions 41b of the somewhat resilient attaching tabs first flex or spread apart to allow the attaching tabs to enter the perforations and then return to their original positions to hold the hinge securely against the cabinet wall. It has been found that making the hinge of cold rolled steel of approximately 0.072 inch thickness provides the desired flexibility and resilience. The outer ends of the attaching tabs 41 are seen to curve away from each other as at 410 to facilitate the spreading of the tabs as they are inserted into the perforatrons.\nReferring to FIGS. 46, the end portion 40 of the hinge leaf 36 is slightly longer in the horizontal direction than the hinge leaf 35 and the barrel 37 of the hinge is positioned outwardly from the intermediate portion 42 a sufficient distance to permit the door 26 to be swung inwardly into perpendicular relationship with the cabinet wall -22. As illustrated, the door 26 may freely rotate 180 from the closed position illustrated in FIG. 4 to the fully opened position illustrated in FIG. 6. Further, a gain or recess need not be cut into the door to receive the hinge leaf 35.\nFIG. 7 illustrates the use of the hinges with a center post 22' of a cabinet. The center post 22' is similar to the cabinet wall 22 but supports shelves 23 and 23 extending from both sides of the center wall. The shelf 23 is supported by shelf- support strip 24, and the shelf 23' is supported by the shelf-support strip 24'. A hinge 27' is attached to the left side of the center wall 24' in a manner similar to the hinge 27, but the hinge 27' is attached in an inverted position with respect to the hinge 27. The end portion 40 of the hinge leaf 36 positions the barrel 37 outwardly a sufficient distance to permit the door 26 to swing a full 180 to overlie the door 26 attached to the hinge 27'.\nWhen it is desired to remove the hinges, a screwdriver or the like may be slipped between the rearward portion 39 and the shelf-support strip, and the attaching tabs 41 may be pried from the perforations. The hinges may be removed quickly and easily, and once removed, no unsightly holes or defects appear in the cabinet. Similarly, the hinges may be easily attached merely by inserting the tongue 44 into the groove 31 and pushing the attaching tabs 41 into the perforations in the shelf-support strip. The rib 32 of the wall is gripped between the tongue 44 and the rearward portion 39 of the hinge, and the tabs 41 hold the intermediate portion 42 squarely against the front of the rib, thereby securing the hinge against movement in any direction. The tabs 41 lie along a line parallel with the barrel 37 and the length of the intermediate portion 42, and the barrel is held in a vertical position.\nReferring to FIGS. l214, a modified hinge 127 similarly includes hinge leaves 135 and 136 rotatably joined at the barrel 137. The hinge leaf 135 is attached to the door 126 by screws 146 as described hereinbefore with respect to the hinge 27. The hinge 127 includes a rearward portion 139, an intermediate portion 142, and an end portion 143, but rather than a single projection which is received by the groove 131 in the cabinet wall 122, the leaf 136 includes a pair of projections 144. Further, the projections 144 are punched and bent out from the intermediate portion 142 rather than the end portion 143.\nAttaching tabs 141 extend from the top and bottom of the rearward end of the portion 139, and the attaching tabs 141 have the same shape as the tabs 41 previously discussed. However, the distance between the tabs 141 is equal to the minimum distance between four perforations 134 of the shelfsupport strip 124 rather than five perforations. A pair of screw holes 147 are provided in the rearward portion 139 aligned with the attaching tabs 141, and two round head screws 148 may be inserted through the holes into perforations 134.\nAnother modification of the hinge is illustrated in FIGS. l17. The hinge 227 is designed for use with shelf- support strips 224 which are not recessed into the cabinet wall 222. The advantage of this modification is that the hinge can be used to attach a door to a cabinet which did not previously have shelf-support strips. The hinge 227 is similar to the hinge 127, but the rearward portion 239 includes a laterally offset end portion 2390 which extends parallel to the major portion of the rearward portion 239 and is offset therefrom by shoulder 239k which extends laterally outwardly from the wall. The depth of the shoulder 23% is approximately the same as the horizontal dimension of the channel-shaped shelfsupport strip 224, and the attaching tabs 241 which extend from the offset portion 239a hold the rearward portion 239 securely against the cabinet wall 222. The screws 248 may be used to provide a more secure attachment. The leaf 235 is similarly attached to the door 226 by screws 246.\nIf desired, the rear edge of the rearward portion of the cabinet hinge can be provided with an emboss or a bulge which extends away from the shelf-support strip to permit a screwdriver or other prying tool to be more readily inserted between the shelf-sup ort strip and the cabinet hinge. Further, if a pair of hinges are 0 beused on opposite sides of a cabinet wall, as, for example, in FIG. 7, we have found it desirable to use only a single screw hole in the rearward portion of the hinge. For example, with the hinge illustrated in FIG. 12, only the upper or the lower hole 147 need be used, and, since the brackets on opposite sides of the cabinet wall illustrated in FIG. 7 are upside down with respect to each other, there is no chance that the single screw inserted into each hinge will interfere with the screw for the other hinge.\nWhile in the foregoing specification, detailed descriptions of specific embodiments were set forth for the purpose of illustration, it is to be understood that many of the details hereingiven may be varied considerably by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of our invention.\nWe claim:\n1. In combination with a cabinet wall having its front side provided with a vertically extending slot and a cabinet door, a hinge for attaching the door to the cabinet wall comprising rotatably joined first and second hinge leaves, a first leaf having a substantially planar portion secured to the door, the second leaf having a forward portion and a rearward portion, the rearward portion being substantially planar and lying against a side of the cabinet wall, the forward portion of said second leaf including an intermediate portion extending generally perpendicularly from the rearward portion and lying against said front side, said intermediate portion having a projection extending rearwardly therefrom and spaced from said rearward portion and being received by said vertical slot, and means for attaching said rearward portion to said cabinet wall, said cabinet sidewall having its inner side provided with a support strip having spaced perforations and said rearward leaf portion being provided with attaching tabs for engagement with said perforations.\n2.

    "description": "The field of the invention is drinking cups and the invention relates more particularly to cups adapted with means to reduce the tendency to splash or spill. Such cups are especially useful for coffee, tea and other hot or cold beverages where splashing can be painful as well as inconvenient.\nMany devices are used to reduce the tendency of drinking cups to spill. The most common device is a thin plastic cap which is commonly placed over the upper lid of a paper or plastic cup. For beverages drunk by use of a straw, a straw opening is commonly provided in the lid and provides adequate protection against spills. The straw opening is, of course, not useful for coffee, tea or other hot liquids not typically drunk with a straw. For such liquids it is necessary to remove the lid at which point there is no protection against spilling or slopping. Other no spill approaches are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,360,161, 3,952,910, 3,360,160, 3,549,044, 3,171,580, 3,730,399, 3,868,043, 3,938,695, 2,753,049, 3,994,411 and 3,940,012. All of the devices described in the above listed patents suffer from various deficiencies. A common deficiency is the inability of the user to add cream, sugar, ice, lemon or the like without removing the lid or spill preventer. Similarly, for most of the devices the user cannot use a spoon or other stirring device without removing the lid or baffle.\nIt is the primary object of the present invention to provide a drinking cup which has a substantially reduced tendency to splash or spill while at the same time enabling the user to stir the contents of the cup while still performing a baffling function.\nThe present invention is for a drinking cup having a substantially reduced tendency to spill. The cup has at least two baffle members positioned along the inner surface of the side wall near the upper lip but positioned downwardly therefrom. Each baffle is generally annular in shape and extends outwardly from the cup wall. Each baffle has a central opening at least one-third of the maximum diameter of the inside wall of the cup, and each baffle also has a plurality of passageways passing therethrough from the lower surface to the upper surface thereof.\nThe passageways may be circular holes or elongated slots and preferably are offset so that the passageways in the upper baffle do not coincide with the passageways in the adjacent lower baffle. One or two enlarged slots may be provided to facilitate drinking.\nFIG. 1 is a perspective view of the present invention.\nFIG. 2 is a plan view, partially cut away, of the cup of FIG. 1.\nFIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 3--3 of FIG. 2.\nFIG. 4 is a plan view of an alternate embodiment of the cup of the present invention.\nA cup according to the present invention is indicated by reference character 10 in FIG. 1. The cup has a generally cylindrical side wall 11 and handle 12 of a conventional design. The cup also has an upper baffle 13 and lower baffle 14 described more fully below.\nAs shown in FIG. 2 the upper baffle 13 has six passageways comprising holes 15 and two slots 16. The holes pass completely through the upper baffle as do slots 16. Lower baffle 14 also has a plurality of holes indicated by reference character 17. Eight holes are shown in each baffle but a greater or smaller number may be used. As few as four or as many as twenty-four is contemplated. The number and size of the holes should not be so great as to destroy the baffling effect and thus it is preferred that no more than 50 percent of the area of the baffle consists of holes. The openings are preferably positioned near the mid-point of the annular baffle or if the openings are slots the slots may pass completely through the baffle. Holes 17 are offset from holes 15 and slots 16 so that liquid passing through holes 17 are not likely to be able to likewise pass through holes 15 or slots 16.\nThe two baffles are shown most clearly in cross-sectional view in FIG. 3 where it can be readily seen that the baffles are disposed in the upper half of the cup and substantially below the upper lip thereof so that they do not interfere with drinking from the cup. Slots 16 although useful are not essential for the practice of the present invention. These slots increase the flow of liquid facilitating the more rapid drinking of the contents. A substantial disadvantage of most non-spill cups of the prior art is the difficulty associated with drinking the contents. This is particularly true when fast drinking is desired since many no-spill cups rely on small openings which simply do not permit rapid drinking. Upper baffle 13 has a central opening 20 which should be at least 1/3 of the diameter of the cup and preferably at least 1/2 thereof. Similarly, lower baffle 14 has an opening 21 which similarly should be at least 1/3 and preferably 1/2 the diameter of the cup. In this way, sugar, cream, as well as a spoon may be used in the cup while the baffles are in place.\nWhen the cup is full, the liquid level is slightly below the upper baffle as shown in FIG. 3 where the liquid level is indicated by reference character 22. Even with the liquid level up to the level of the upper baffle 13, the tendency to spill is nonetheless substantially reduced by the presence of the two baffles. More than two baffles may be used in the practice of the present invention and additional lower baffles serve to facilitate the non-spill effect of the present invention. Three or four baffles are very useful with the addition of more baffles being of less effect in that the tendency to spill is not substantially reduced with the use of five baffles as compared to four.\nAn alternate configuration of the present invention is shown in FIG. 4 where the passageways are elongated slots. Slots 25 are positioned in upper baffle 26 and slots 27 are positioned in lower baffle 28. As above, slots 27 are offset from slots 25 to reduce the spilling tendency. Upper baffle 26 has a central opening 29. Lower baffle 28 has a central opening 30, again for the purpose of facilitating stirring and the adding of sugar, cream and the like. The central openings have the further advantage of facilitating the rapid drinking or gulping of the contents as well as for emptying and washing the cup. It is important in the practice of the present invention that the baffles be touching the inner wall of the cup and have a central opening for stirring. Ideally the baffles should be generally annular in shape. While the passageways in the two baffles are shown as offset, it is possible to align the two sets of passageways and the present invention may be practiced with aligned passageways.\nThe present embodiments of this invention are thus to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims therefore are intended to be embraced therein."

LOUIS, MISSOURI.\nBELT-FASTEN ER.\nSPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 640,177, dated January 2, 1900.\nApplication filed July 13, 1899.\nTo all whom it may concern:\nBe it known that 1, JOHN M. OAVINS, a citizen of the United States, residing at- St. Louis, State of Missouri, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Belt-Fasteners, of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, forming a part hereof.\nMy invention has relation to improvements in belt-fasteners; and it consists in the novel arrangement and combination of parts more fully set forthin the specification and pointed out in the claims.\n' In the drawings, Figure 1 is a perspective view of asection of a belt, showing my invention applied thereto. Fig. 2 isatop plan thereof. Fig. 3 is an end view of the fastener, showing the belt, however, in section. Fig. 415 an end view of one of the leaves detached. Fig. 5 is a section on line'5 5 of Fig. 4, showing, however, the complete hinge, with the addition of the hinge-pin and Fig. 6 is a perspective of the hinge-pin detached.\nThe object of my invention is to construct a belt-fastener which will effect a hinged connection between the adjacent ends of the belt fastened or coupled thereby, one which will permit the ready coupling or uncoupling of said ends, one which will insure a maximum resistance to tensile strain to which the belt may be subjected, one which produces a minimum degree of stiffness on either side of the hinge-line, and one possessing further and other advantages more apparent from a detailed description of the invention, which is as follows:\nReferring to the drawings, 1 represents either leaf or section of the hinge by which the connection between the ends of the belt is elfected, said leaf being formed of a single piece of metal folded or bent against itself, the free edges of the folded members being flush with one another. Disposed along the edge of the inner member or that which comes in direct contact with the belt 2 are a series of arms or prongs 3, integral with the said member and deflected substantially at right angles thereto, said arms serving to secure said member to the belt. Projecting from the free edge of the outer folded member of the leaf and disposed immediately over the arms 3 are a second series of securing-arms Serial No. 728,684. (No model.)\n4, the bases 4. of which serve to remove the arms 4 proper from the arms 3 a distance equal substantially to the thickness of the belt, the arms 3 being themselves removed from the hinge-line a distance equal to the thickness of the belt. The distance between the outer end of the leaf and the center of the adjacent or terminal prong is equal to one-half the distance between the centers of any two successive prongs, these distances serving to distribute the strain on the hinge to best advantage.\nThe edge along which the metal or original sheet is folded is formed into a loop 5, the diameter of which corresponds approximately to the thickness of the belt, this arrangement permitting perfect freedom of deflection of the belt on either side of the hinge-linge as the belt passes around the pulley. The loop 5 is recessed at intervals, the recesses of one leaf receiving the solid portions remaining on either side of the recesses of the other leaf, so that when the two leaves are assembled the metal will be continuous along the hinge-line. The loops 5 are bentinwardly, so as to come entirely between the opposite ends of the belt, the ends of the belt each abutting against the adjacent wall of the loop of its respective leaf. When the leaves are assembled in the manner indicated, a hinge- pin 6 is inserted into the common opening of the loops, the pin being preferably formed of a single piece of wire of sufficient length and substantially semicylindrical in cross-section doubled upon itself along its plane or flat face, whereby when the pin is completed it will be practically cylindrical. The spring or resiliency of the arms of the bent pin insures its remaining in place within its housing; but as a further precaution against the working out of said pin I form a slight node or swell 6 along one of the arms thereof,said node insuring suflicient fric tional contact for the purpose of retaining the pin in place under ordinary circumstances.\nWhile the fastening-prongs 3 and at are here= in shown as superposedthat is, one prong 4. being directly over its corresponding inner prong 3it is obvious that they may alternate or break joint 'with one another; but the arrangement here shown is the preferred one from a standpoint of economy. After the prongs 3 at have been inserted into the mate rial of the belt the projecting ends are bent against the belt in a direction toward the hinge-line, as best seen in Fig. 3. The present construction of hinge is economical and durable, and when the respective sections are assembled they form a hinge which is pliable, permitting the belt to pass over the pulley with a minimum degree of stifiness.\nHaving described my invention, what I claim is 1. As an article of manufacture, a belt-fastener comprising two leaves or sections, each composed of a single piece of metal folded or doubled against itself, the free edges of the folded members being substantially even or flush with one another, a series of securing arms or prongs deflected from the edge of the member immediately in contact with the belt, a series of securing-arms formed integrally with the upper or exposed member, the bases of said arms being extended outwardly beyond the edge of said member, a loop formed along the line of the fold and turned wholly below the plane of the exposed member of the folded section, the diameter of the loop corresponding approximately to the thickness of the belt, the loops of the respective sect-ions being recessed whereby they may be coupled, and a hinge-pin inserted into said loops, substantially as set forth.\n2. As an article of manufacture, a belt-fastener comprising two leaves or sections, each composed of a single piece of metal folded or doubled against itself, the free edges of the folded members being substantially even or flush with one another, a series of securing arms or prongs deflected from the edge of the member immediately in contact with the belt, a series of securing-arms formed integrally with the upper or exposed member, the bases of said arms being extended outwardly beyond the edge of said member, a loop formed along the line of the fold of each leaf or sec tion, the loops of the respective sections being recessed whereby they may be coupled pivotally together, substantially as set forth.\nIn testimony whereof I affix my signature in presence of two witnesses.\nJOHN M. OAVINS."

SAIVYER, OF MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA, ASSIGNOR OFONF- HALF TO ANDREV ANDERSON, OF SAME PLACE.\nSPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 640,232, dated January 2, 1900.\nApplication filed June 19l 1399, Serial Noz 721,026. (No model.)\nTo LZ/Z LL/72,0712, t may concern:\nBe it known that I, CHARLES H. SAWYER, oit' Minneapolis, county of Hennepin, State of Minnesota, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Boats, of which the following is a speciiication.\nMy invention relates to boats for conveying freight or passengers from place to place and in which a gas or similar compact engine is particularly adapted for the motive power.\nThe objects of the invention are to provide means whereby the boat may be driven through the water at a high rate of speed, and to provide a boat that shall be strong and durable in construction, though simple and economical to manufacture.\nThe invention consists generally in a boat having its hull or lower portion provided with an inclosing shell or casing adapted to revolve about the hull in a series of wings or spirals provided upon said shell and means contained within said hull for driving said shell.\nFurther, the invention consists in an ovalshaped hull, a similar-shaped shell inclosing the same, water-tight joints being provided between said hull and the ends of said shell, a series of wings or spirals provided on said shell, a circular track provided between said shell and said hull, trucks arranged within said hull and resting upon said track, and means for driving' said truck.\nFurther, the invention consists in various constructions and combinations, all as hereinafter described, and particularly pointed out in the claims.\nIntlie accompanyingdrawings,forniingpart of this specification, Figure l is a longitudinal sectional view of a boat or vessel embodying my invention. Fig. 2 is a transverse sectional view of the oval or cylindrical portion of the hull of the boat or launch. Fig. 3 is a detail view showing a construction of the water-tight joint between the hull and the revolving shell.\nAs shown in Fig. 1 of the drawings, the hull of the boat or launch comprises a middle oval or substantially cylindrical portion 2, slightly tapered at its end and provided at its for ward end with the upright extension 3 and at its rear end with a similar extension 4,\nwhercon the rudder 5 is supported. The portion 2 of the hullis open at each end, and access may be had to the interior of the hull down the extensions 3 and 4 and through the open end of the middle portion. The hull of the boat may be constructed of wood or metal, as preferred, and its middle portion is covered by a planking 6, which terminates at the inner edges of the'parts 3 and fi. Above the planking (3 there may be another deck laid, if preferred, or the deck 6 may be regarded as the upper deck of the boat and suitably railed and protected from the sun. The tops of the extensions 3 and 4 extend above the part 2 of the vessel, so that a space is formed between said part and the deck 6, and as a means for driving said boat I prefer to provide a shell 7, inclosing the hull 2 and having open ends opposite the open end of the hull and separated therefrom by suitable bearings comprising an inner ring 8 at each end of the hull, having an annular ledge or shoul* der 9 and secured to the surface of the hull. Outer rings 10 are provided on the shell 7 at each end and have annular grooves 11 in their faces to receive balls 12, provided between said rings 9 and l0. Rings 13, of leather or other iiexible material, are secured to the edges of the rings 12 and bear upon said rings 9, being held in engagement at all times with said rings by springs let, so that when the boat or vessel is in use a water-tight joint will be formed between the ends of the outer shell and the hull, and the passage of water into the hull or into the space between the hull and the revolving shell will be prevented.\nUpon the outer surface of the shell 7 I pro vide a series of spirals or wings 15, having their ends secured to the surface of the shell and winding about the same, so that when said shell is revolved the spirals will engage the water and cause the boat to attain a high speed. In order that the shell 7 may be revolved, I prefer to provide a gasolene-engine 16 within the inner hull 2, and trucks 17, having their edges projecting through openings 18 in the inner hull and resting upon the annular track 19, provided upon the inner surface of said shell 7 between said shell and the inclosed portion of the hull. Suitable connections are provided between the trucks 17 IOO and said engine for driving said truck, and the friction of the same upon the track 19 is sufficient to revolve the shell 7 at a high rate of speed. I prefer to provide guide-Wheels 2O in front and inV the rear of said truck 17 and connected with the axle of the same, and I also prefer to provide angle- iron braces 21 between said engine 16 and the top of the curved portion of the hull.\nThe operation of my improved boat or launch is as follows: The engine having been started, the trucks 17 will revolve with,their axle and engaging the track 19 will cause the shell 7 to revolve also, and the wings or spirals provided on the outer surface of the shell will be forced through the water and cause the boat to move forward at a great speed. Owing to the ball-bearing connection between the ends of the revolving shell and the hull of the boat very little power will be required to revolve the shell, and the water-tight joint provided between the shell and the hull, as\nheretofore described, will eectually prevent any water leaking into the vessel or into the space between the hull and the revolving shell. Upon reversing the engine the revolving shell will be driven in the opposite direction and the forward motion of the boat arrested, and whenever desired the boat may be backed by reversing the normal direction of revolution of the inclosing shell.\nObviously in many respects the details of my invention may be modified, and I do not therefore desire to confine myself to the construction herein shown and described.\nHaving thus described my invention, I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent-- 1. The combination, with the hull having an oval middle portion, of a revolving shell inclosin g said oval middle portion, spirals provided upon said shell water-tight joints between said shell and said hull, a circular track provided between said shell and said hull, trucks provided within said hull and resting upon said track, and means for revolving said truck, substantially as described.\n2. A boat or vessel, comprising a hull substantially cylindrical in cross-section having at each end upright extensions through which access maybe had to the interior of said hull, a deck supported upon said extensions and extending over said hull, a shell inclosing said hull between said upright extensions, water-tight joints bein g provided between the ends of said shell and said hull, a series of spirals provided on the surface of said shell, and means for revolving said shell, substantially as described.\n' 3. In a boat, the combination, with a hull, substantially cylindrical in cross-section, of a revolving shell inclosing said hull, watertight joints being formed between the ends of said shell and said hull, a series of spirals provided on the surface of said shell, a track provided onthe inner surface of said shell, and a friction device arranged wit-hin said shell and engaging said track and whereby said shell is revolved, substantially as described'.\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 13th day of June, 1899.\nCHARLES H. SAWYER.\nIn presence of M. C. NOONAN, RICHARD PAUL."

(No model.)\nTo @ZZ whom it i12/(ty concern:\nBe it known that we, RANSOM R. SPOORE, residing at Newark, in the county of lVayne, and JOSEPH M. RAUB, residing at New York, (Brooklym) in the county of Kings, State of New York, citizens of the United States, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Fence-Posts; and we do hereby declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, such as will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to malte and use the same.\nOurinvention has relation to improvements in fence-posts, and more particularly for posts used in constructing wire fences; and it consists in the novel construction, combination, and arrangement of parts of which it is com posed, as will be hereinafter more fully eX- plained, and particularly pointed out in the appended claims.\nThe annexed drawings, to which reference is had, fully illustrate our invention, in which- Figure l represents a front View of our device. Fig. 2 is arear view of the same. Fig. 3 is a vertical sectional View. Fig. 4 is ahorizontal sectional view, and Fig. 5 is a face view in blank form of the attachable anchor or base.\nReferring by letter to the accompanying drawings, A designates a fence-post constructed of iron and having side flanges a a, which are extendedM at the lower end of the post, as at b, and the extreme ends c c are bent outwardly, forming a base for the support of the post, and in connection with these bent ends the end of the main portion of the post, as at CZ, is slit vertically and the ends e e thereofl are bent in opposite directions, providing a cross-base for the post to rest upon. Thus the latter is supported by four feet, and each foot extends in a different direction, which forms a substantial base or support for the post. Above these feet we provide a second base or support for the post in the form of a plate B, the same having its ends slit or cut, as atf, leaving four fingers g, which when the plate is applied to the post are bent around the side flanges thereof and firmly grip said flanges and hold the plate thereto. This plate serves as a base or anchor and is de seated, and these wires are firmly held to the post by a tie-wire j, one end of which is wrapped around the line-wire on one side of the post and the other end of said tie-wire is wrapped around said line-wire on the opposite side of said post. Thus when the loop portion L of said tie-wire passes over the front of the post, as at Z, it gives the tie-wire a firm hold upon the post.\nThe upper end of the post is made ornamental, as at 7n, and an attaching-plate n, having a stem 0, provided with a perforation to receive a rivet p, that also passes through a perforation in the top of said post, is clenched or headed, thereby securin g the top plate permanently to said post, thus providing an ornamental post end.\nThus it will be observed from the above de scription, when taken in connection with the annexed drawings, that the upper base has its securing-fingers cut from the plate and bent around the flanges of the post, leaving the remainder of the plate projecting on either side of the post, providing an excellent and substantial support or brace for the base, and the tie-wires firmly grip and hold the horizontal fence-wires in place, while the attachable top plate serves to provide an ornamental post, while the feet of the postare formed integral therewith, extending in four directions, the side feet being formed of the extensions of the side flanges of said post, and the fingers of the base-plate beinga part of or formed integral with said plate are easily and readily bent around the anges of the post, when they will firmly hold said plate in position, and thus prevent the fence-post from swaying in any direction, and a fence-post as herein described is durable, ornamental, and at the same time cheaply manufactured.\nHaving thus described ourinvention, what we claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-m l. The combination in a metal fencepost IOO having the right-angular side flanges, provided with notches for the fence-wires and bent arms providing anchorage for said post, of the base-plate having the longitudinal slits 5 f, extending from the outer ends of said plate leaving the lingers g, at each end of the plate, the sanne adapted to be bent around the side ilanges ofthe post, whereby said plate is firmly held thereto, as herein shown and described.\n2.

(No model.)\nTo all 1071/0721, it nm/g concern:\nBe it known that we, ARTHUR \\V. LYDA and WILLIAM L. TURNER, citizens of the United States, residing at Blairsville, in the county of Indiana and State of Pennsylvania, have invented a new and useful Folding Ladder, of which the following is a specification.\nThe invention relates to improvements in folding ladders.\nThe object of the present invention is to improve the construction of folding ladders, more especially the means for hinging the sections thereof and for securing the same in alinement, and to provide a simple, inexpensive, and efficient hinge adapted to permit the sections of the ladder to be arranged to form a straight or extension ladder and to be disposed at an angle to each other to form a painters trestle, and also to be compactly folded for storing and shipping.\nThe invention consists in the construction and novel combination and arrangement of parts hereinafter fully described, illustrated in the accompanying drawings, and pointed out in the claims hereto appended.\nIn the drawings, Figure 1 is a perspective view of a portion of a folding ladder provided with hinges constructed in accordance with this invention, the sections of the ladder being arranged at an angle to each other. Fig. 2 is a similar view, the sections being arranged in alinement. Fig. 3 is an enlarged detail perspective view of the hinge. Fig. 4; is a similar view of the pivoted latch. Fig. 5 is a detail sectional view taken transversely of one of the leaves of the hinge and illustrating the manner of mounting the latch. Fig. 6 is a detail sectional view illustrating a modification of the invention and showing a coiled spring for holding the latch in engagement with the lug or projection.\nLike numerals of reference designate corresponding parts in all the figures of the drawings.\n1 and :2 designate sections of a folding ladder which is provided with hinges 3, composed of sections or leaves 4 and 5, secured to the adjacent ends of the sections 1 and 2 and adapted to permit the same to fold against each other for arranging the ladder compactly for shipping and storing and capable of enabling the said sections to be disposed at an angle, as illustrated in Fig. 1, or in alinement, as shown in Fig. 2, to provide a painters trestle, and to form a straight or extension ladder. Each of the leaves or sections con sists of an oblong box or casing and comprises a face-plate, parallel sides, and a connecting end piece, and the said leaves or sections are provided at their adjacent ends with eyes 6 and 7, located at the inner or rear sides and receiving a piutle 8. The adjacent ends of the leaves abut against each other when the ladder-sections are arranged in alinement to form a straight or extension ladder, as illustrated in Fig. 2 of the accompanying drawin gs. The face-plates of the leaves or sections may be constructed of open-work to provide a light and ornamental hinge, and they are per forated for the reception of screws or other suitable fastening devices for securing them to the ends of the side bars of the ladder-sections, which are strengthened thereby.\nThe leaves of the hinge are securely fastened when in alinement by a latch 9, L- shaped in cross-section, composed of two longitudinal flanges 10 and 11, arranged, respectively, on the face-plates and on the outer sides of the leaves or sections when the same are arranged in alinement. The inner end 12 of the flange 10 is enlarged and provided with a tapering opening 13 to receive an annular boss 14, extending around the perforation of the face-place of the leaf or section 3, and the parts are secured together by a pivot 15, extending through the opening 13 and the adjacent perforation of the leaf or section 3. The outer end of the flange 10 is enlarged and provided with a recess 16, arranged to engage a lug or projection 17, extending outward from the face-plate of the leaf or section 4, and the extremity of the flange 10 is rounded to form a beveled face or edge 18 to enable the latch to engage the lug or projection automatically. The latch is retained in engagement with the lug or projection 17 by a flat spring 19, secured to the inner end of the flange 11 and extending longitudinally thereof and bearing against the adjacent side of the leaf or section, as clearly illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 of the drawings. The outer end of the spring is free, and the outer end of the flange 11 is enlarged and offset to provide an inner recess 19 to receive the inner end of the spring and to enable the inner face of the same to be ar ranged flush with the inner face of the flange.\nInstead of employing a flat spring for holding the latch in engagement with the lug or projection a coiled spring 22 may be used, as illustrated in Fig. 6 of the accompanying drawings. The coiled spring 22 is located within the leaf or section 5 and is interposed between the inner face of the upper side of the same and a stop 23 of a pin or rivet 24, extending through a slot 25 of the said leaf or section 5 and connected with the latch at a point in advance of the pivot thereof. This construction provides a smooth exterior surface for the ladder. The pivotal movement of the latch is limited by a fastening device 20, mounted on the leaf or section 3 and extending through a transverse slot 21 of the flange 10 of the latch.\nIt will be seen that the means for connecting the sections of the ladder and for securing the same when in alinement are simple and comparatively inexpensive in construction, strong and durable, and capable of enabling the sections of the ladder to be arranged in alinement to form a straight or extension ladder, and to be disposed at an angle for staging purposes, and to be compactly folded for shipping and storing. It will also be apparent that the hinge, which is applicable to light ladders, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings, may also be applied 7 to heavy trussed ladders, where the braces or trusses have central flexible portions to permit the ladder to break at the joint.\nWhat is claimed is- 1. A device of the class described comprising a hinge composed of two leaves or sections hinged together and each consisting of a face-plate, sides, and a connecting end piece, a lug or projection extending from the side of one of the leaves, a latch L-shaped in crosssection mounted on the other section and composed of two longitudinal flanges conforming to the configuration of the leaves or sections, the side flange being provided at its inner face with a recess for engaging the lug or projection, and a longitudinal spring secured to and extending from the inner end of the top flange and arranged flat against and engaging the top of the adjacent leaf or section, substantially as described.\n2. A device of the class described comprising a hinge composed of two leaves or sections hinged together at the bottom, a latch L-shaped in cross-section located at the top and composed of two longitudinal flanges, the side flange being slotted between its ends, pivoted at its inner end and provided at its outer end with an interior recess, a lug extending from one side of the hinge and arranged to be engaged by the recess of the latch, a fastening device mounted on the hinge and extending through the slot of the latch, and a spring arranged at the top of the hinge and cooperating with the top flange of the latch, substantially as and for the purpose described.\nIn testimony that we claim the foregoing as our own we have hereto aflixed our signatures in the presence of two witnesses.\nARTHUR W. LYDA. WILLIAM L. TURNER.\nWitnesses:\nELSA WIGGINS, H. G. MILLIKEN."

BARGAR, OF CARBONDALE, PENNSYLVANIA.\nNAIL-HOLDING DEVICE.\nSPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 640,169, dated January 2, 1900.\nApplication filed J uly 20, 1899. Serial No. 724,484. (No model.)\nT0 at whom it may concern.-\nBe it known that I, WILLIS R. BARGAR, a citizen of the United States, residing at Oarbondale, in the county of Lackawanna and State of Pennsylvania, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in N ail-Holding Devices; and I do declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, such as will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same, reference being bad to the accompanying drawings, and to the letters of reference marked thereon, which form a part of this specification.\nThis invention relates to new and useful improvements in devices for holding nails to hammer-heads while being driven; and it consists in the provision of means whereby the head of the nail may be held adjacent to the head of the hammer and at right angles to the striking-face thereof, whereby the nail may be started by giving the latter a light blow with the side of the head of the hammer, after which the nail is released from the notch holding the same, and the nail may then be driven with the striking-face of the hammer.\nMore specifically, the present invention consists in the provision of a nail-holding device consisting of a piece of wire which is bent and formed into a V-shaped portion designed to receive the head of the nail, thence said wire being bent or coiled to form two loops, through which short rods are passed, the shank portions of the wire thence bent at substantially right angles to the portion containing the nailcarrying loop and again bent to form eyes, through which a second rod passes, the free ends of the wire being bent at right angles and having hooks at their ends which are adapted to be interlocked after the ends are passed about the handle of the hammer. By this provision it Will be noted that the nailholding device may be held tightly against the head of a hammer, and by means of the spring-arms formed by the ends of the wire the nail-holding attachment is held snugly against the side or face of the hammer.\nTo these ends and to such others as the invention may pertain, the same consists, further, in the novel construction, arrangement, and adaptation of parts, as will be hereinafter more fully described, and then specifically defined in the appended claims.\nMy invention is clearly illustrated in the accompanying drawings, which, with the letters of reference marked thereon, form part of this application, and in which drawings similar letters of reference indicate like parts throughout both views, in which-- Figure 1 is a side elevation of a hammer, showing my improved nail-holding device se cured to thehandle and side of the hammerhead; and Fig. 2 is an enlarged detail View of the device removed from the hammer and handle.\nReference now being bad to the details of the drawings by letter, A designates the piece of wire, which is bent upon itself at A, with a slight space intervening, as at B. Said wire is bent to form a coil at B, and the two rightangled wing portions 0 are formed out of the wire, after which the eyes D are formed by coiling the wire. Thence right-angled pro jectingportions E of the wire are bent and a second series of eyes F formed, and the ends of the wires are thence bent substantially at right angles to the portions of the wire be tween the said sets of eyes and at their extreme ends are provided with hooks H. Mounted in each set of eyes D and F are the rods K, which when the device is placed upon the handle of a hammer are disposed on opposite sides thereof, as shown clearly in Fig. 1 of the drawings. A\nThe application and operation of my device are as follows, viz: The Wire nail-holding device is slipped over the end of the handle of the hammer, the handle passing between the two rods K, and after the device has been pushed up to the head of the hammer, so that the looped or nailengaging portion rests against the side of the hammer-head, the spring-arms, having hooks Hat their ends, are bent over the hammer-handle and the ends interlocked on the side of the handle on which the nail holding portion is disposed. By bringing these arms about the handle and in terlocking the same the tension caused/by bending said ends will cause the nail carrying portion to snugly bind,agaihst the hammer and hold the same firmly in place.\nHaving thusdescribed my invention, what I claim to be new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is\n1. A device for holding nails to hammerheads, consisting of a wire which is bent to 5 form a nail-receiving slot, said wire thence being bent to form two sets of eyes, rods mounted in said eyes, adapted to be held one on each side of the handle of a hammer, and the ends of said wires being hooked and adapted to be 10 sprung over the handle and interlocked, as\nshown and described.\n2. A nail-holding device for hammer-heads,\nconsisting of a wire which is bent to form a V-shaped slot, thence bent to form two pairs I5 of eyes, and the rods held in said eyes parallel to each other, and at right angles to the nail-carrying slot, the ends of said wire being thence downwardly bent and having hooks whereby when the device is placed upon the handle of a hammer, said ends may be inter- 2o locked and the tension of the spring-arms when interlocked may cause the nail-slot to bear against the face of the hammer, as set forth.\nIn testimony whereof I affix my signature 2 5 in presence of two Witnesses.\nWILLIS R. BARGAR. Witnesses:\nW. E. FRIsBIE, GEO. H. ACKERMAN."

Seria1No.'718,575. (N0 model.) I\nTo all whom it may concern.-\nBe it known that I, LORENZO D. BENNER, a citizen of the United States,residing at Peoria, in the county of Peoria and State of Illinois, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Paper Bags; and I do hereby declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, which will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same.\nMy invention relates to a new and novel construction of paper bags and the method of making the same, the object being to form a satchel-bottom bag collapsed into convenient form for shipment and readily expandible into a rectangular box-like form, the construction being such that in the manufacture of the same the waste of paper will be reduced to a minimum.\nThe construction of the bag will be best understood from a description of its mode of manufacture, in connection with the drawings, in which it is illustrated and in which the figures as they are numbered show in their order the various steps of the method of producing the bag, in which- Figure 1 is a plan view showing the manner of cutting the tube or forming the same into convenient lengths. Fig. 2 is a view showing the second step in the process of manufacture. Fig. 3 is a plan showing a further step in the process, wherein the side extensions are folded down upon themselves. Fig. 4 is a view showing the folds ofthe bag preparatory to being brought together and pasted. Fig. 5 shows a bag collapsed and as it appears when completed, and Fig. 6 is a View of the bottom as it appears when the bag is opened or filled.\nIn the drawings,A is a tubular section,made of suitable length, cut from a strip in such a manner as to provide the side extensions a. In separating the tube into suitable lengths, as is shown in Fig. 1, I form the overlapping sections of the bottom by cutting the sides only, so as to form an arc of a circle, the end extensions a of one bag being cut out of the adjacent strip of tube or bag of which it forms a part, which leaves at the opposite end of the 'bag the protruding end of the, bellows sides B, as is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe first step in the operation is to grip the extensions a and fold them back upon themselves on the line a, which will form a crease in the bellows sides B on the diagonal lines I), forming the crease b, which forms a triangular fold Z) of the sides a upon itself, the process of folding providing the triangular extensions 0, which represent the folds of the bellows sides folded down upon themselves. The extensions a are purposed to be folded back on the lines c 0 so that when they are brought together (the operation of which is well illustrated in Fig. 4) they may be overlapped upon each other or folded back and then brought together and pasted. Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate the manner in which I prefer to paste the side extensions together, wherein the end of one side (which may be either of the folds folded back on the lines 0' 0 is folded back against itself as ,the sides are brought together and the opposite side is caused to overlap the same and pasted down.\nIn the process of pasting the extensions a it may be found desirable to perforate the triangular fold b or cut the same away when severing the tube preparatory to folding the same, which would enable me' to secure the triangular extensions 0 to the outside lengths of the bag. This is not really necessary; but in the construction of the bagI do not wish to limit myself to the exact manner of retaining the parts together, as is shown in the drawings.\nHaving thus fully described my invention, what I claim, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is- I 1. The method of making a bellows-folded satchel-bottom bag, which consists in severing the length of a bag from a plain tube in such a manner as to provide extended side portions from one end and protruding bellows-side extensions from the opposite end, folding the extensions back upon themselves forming triangular side extensions in the bellows sides, redoubling the extensions over the triangular extensions and folding the ends of the side extensions in such a manner as to complete the bag by forming overlapping ends when pasted down.\n2. The described method of making a pa per bag, which consists in forming a blank as to provide extended side portions at one end and protruding bellows sides at the opposite end, folding the extensions back upon themselves on the line a, forming the triangular bellows-sides extensions 0, causing the extensions to be redoubled upon themselves forming the triangular folds b b folding back the extensions a, as to overlap the extensions c, so as to bring the inner matching faces of the sides a, adjacent to each other and completing the bag by folding either of the end extensions a, and overlapping the 0pextended side portions a, a, from an extended tube and folding the same back on the line a, a, the iuturned bellows-sided portions 0, the overlapping portions b, contiguous therewith, and the matching and overlapping end extensions of the sides a, when pasted down completing the bottom of the bag.\n5. The herein-described bag provided with the side extensions a, having protruding ends which are purposed to extend beyond and overlap the inturned portions 0, and the overlapping portions b, of the bellows sides, in such a manner as to complete the bag by forming overlapping ends when pasted down.\nIn testimony whereof I aflix my signature in presence of two witnesses.\nLORENZO D. BENNER.\n\\Vitnesses:\nCHAS. W. LA PoR'rE, CHARLES CHARVAT."

JULlEN-DU-SAULT, FRANCE.\nRAZOR.\nsnemmmon forming part of Letters Patent No. 640,209, dated January 2, 1906.\nApplication filed June 27,1899. Serial No. 722,100. (No model.)\nTo aZZ whom it may concern.-\nBe it known that I, J ULES EMILE LERESCHE, manufacturer, a citizen of the Republic of France, and a resident of St. J ulien-du-Sault, France, have invented new and useful Improvements in Razors with Removable Blades, of which the following is a specification.\nThis invention relates to razors having removable blades.\nAccording to my invention I secure the blade into the groove of the blade-carrier by means of a lever mounted upon the bladecarrier and the head of which is so arranged as to act in the manner of a cam or eccentric. This head,together with the blade-carrier and the back of the blade, is so formed that by depressing the lever for fixing the blade the said lever exercises two actions simultaneously upon the blade viz. on the one hand it draws the blade into the groove and retains it there and on the. other hand it pushes it longitudinally, so causing it to press strongly against the abutment formed for this purpose in the carrier at a suitable part. Thus the blade is retained in and securely fixed to the blade-carrier at two independent points viz., at the head of the lever and at the abutment of the carrier. By lifting up the lever the head thereof presses against the back of the blade and in this manner forces the same out of the groove in the carrier, whereby the removing of the blade is facilitated in case it sticks or is otherwise retained in the groove say by rust, or through the deformation of the parts, or from any cause whatever.\nMy invention will be readily understood from the accompanying drawings, in whichshowing another modification.\nThe same letters of reference designate the same parts in all the figures.\na designates the blade-carrier, and b the removable blade, the back of which is engaged in the groove 0 of the blade-carrier.\ndis the lever, which is mounted in a recess 6, formed for its reception in the back of the blade-carrier. and constituting the working part of the lever. I\nIn Figs. 1 and 2 I have shown the blade provided with a kind of beak g at its rear f is the head, forming a camend designed to engage and to hook into the ed upon by the rear short arm f of the lock- 7 ing-lever d to hold the blade firmly on its seat or abutment k, as shown in Fig. 2.\nIn order to fix the blade in position,it suffices to place it as shown at Fig. 1 and then to de press the lever, as indicated by the arrow 1, when the head of the said lever acts on the portion i, and thereby pushes the blade in the direction indicated by the arrow 2, thus causing the beak g to be firmly secured in the abutment h. As the recesst' is curved toward the front end of the blade, the latteris at the same time caused, by the action of the lever-head f, to\nturn on the point g, as is indicated by the arrow 3, and thereby moved fully into the groove 0, as shown at Fig. 2, in which position it is securely retained owing to being engaged and strongly pressed at e by the head f, and also-at g in the abutment h. For detaching the blade I) it suffices to move the lever 01 from the position Fig. 2 into the position Fig. 1. Toward the end of this movement the head f of the lever produces a strong pressure upon the part j of the recess t'j, and Y and left portions of the blade-carrier. The groove e may, however, be extended to the extremity of the blade-carrier, when the portion 'm may be replaced by a screw or pivot, forming a distance-piece. Again, the lever 01 may extend to the end of the blade-carrier, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. In this case it is preferable to form the end of the lever somewhat like a button 02, bent without protruding beyond the right and left hand sides of the blade-carrier.\nI would remark that the fixing of the blade I) by means of the head f of a lever d, which draws it into the groove of the blade-carrier and forces it into an abutment in the bladecarrier, forms the main feature of my invention. The form and disposition of the said abutment are, however, of secondary importance. Thus it is not necessary for the abutment to be designed to retain the blade by hooking together, because the blade is drawn into and retained in the groove of the bladecarrier by the lever, so that as a matter of fact the beak 9 may be omitted, as shown in Fig. 3.\nAs to the disposition of the abutment, this may be varied to a large extent. Thus the abutment may be formed as shown at Ya, forming the end of the groove e, the shape being somewhat similar to that shown in Figs. 1 and 2, so that the part1 of the blade is pressed into it by depressing the lever 61.\nThe lever may be inverted-that is to say, it may be disposed-so as to move down toward the razor-handle instead of turning toward the front end of the blade. It then acts to force the blade against an abutment arranged at a point of the blade-carrier between the lever and the end of the bladefor example, near the front end of the bladecarrier. Fig. 5 shows a convenient arrangement of this kind, in which the abutment is formed by a pin h, which passes across the groove in the blade-carrier and with which the blade engages by the side q of a recess r.\nI claim- A razor comprising a blade-carrier grooved to receive the blade, a locking-lever pivotally connected with said carrierand provided with a cam-head, an abutment on the carrier, and a removable blade provided with a projection on its back having a cam-face engaged by the cam-head of the aforesaid locking-lever, and a seat-face engaging the abutment on the carrier, the cam-head of said lever acting to draw the blade into the carrier-groove and force the seat-faceof said blade against and hold it to said abutment, substantially as set forth.\nIn testimony that I claim the foregoing as my invention I have signed my name, in presence of two witnesses, this 31st day of May,- 1899.\nJULES EMILE LERESOHE.\n\\Vitnesses:\nJ.

(No modelh To all whom it may concern:\nBe it known that I, FREDERIQW. HUNTER, a citizenof the United States, residing at Oranford, in the county of Union and State of New Jersey, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Seats, (Case E,) of which the following is a specification.\nThe invention is especially applicable to seats for railway and similar vehicles, and will be described herein in that connection. Its object is to produce a seat consisting of but few parts, which shall be simple and durable in construction, inexpensive of manufacture, and which shall be easily and readily adjustable.\nThe invention concerns more particularly that type of seats occupying a fixed position,\nand in which-the seat-cushion and seat-back are adjusted or rearranged accordingly as the seat is designed to face one way or the other.\nIt further concerns that class of seats of the type mentioned in which mechanism is provided intermediate of the back and seat cushion, whereby the movement of the former produces a corresponding movement of the latter. In seats of this class the seat-cushion is adapted for lateral adjustment in order that in one or the other position of these seat elements each will bear to the other the proper relation.\nIn carrying out my invention I employ a frame and a movable cushion supported thereby. I also employ a seat-back provided with downwardly-extended supporting-arms pivoted at their lower ends to the floor or the lower portion of the frame. Intermediate of said supporting-arms and of' said movable cushion I employ mechanism for shifting the latter upon the movement of the former. In the present instance this mechanism consists of a pivoted lever at each end of the seat. The lower end of each of these levers is connected, directly or indirectly, with the backsupporting arms, while the upper end of each coacts through suitable gearing with the under side of the cushion. This coaction is secured in the present instance by forming the upper ends of the pivoted levers into toothed segments, and these are arranged to cooper- The upper ends of the members A A are preferably flanged inwardly at ato form a groove in which operates the flanged supportin g member?) of the cushion or cushion-frame B. 'Said cushion has transverse movement upon the seat-frame.\nO designates the seat-back. This is mounted upon downwardly-extended supportingarms D, here shown as pivoted at their lower ends to the ends of the rod 01, forming part of the frame and extending through the members A A.\nE designates the foot-rest. This is here shown as consisting of a rod or pipe extend ing between and connected at its ends to the supportingarms D. It operates through elongated slots a, formed in the member's'A A of the frame.\nF F designate the seat-shifting levers. Each of these is pivoted at f to the frame. The lower end of each lever is provided with an elongated slot f, through which extends the foot-rest E. Thenpper end of each lever F is segmental in form and provided with the toothed periphery f This periphery is concentric with the pivot f, and the teeth thereon engage with the teeth formed in the tracks f secured to the under side of the cushion or cushion-frame B.\nIn Fig. 1 the seat is illustrated in one of its two positions. To reverse it, it is only necessary to move the back 0 to the right, there-' by of course moving the foot-rest E in the same direction. This movement of the footrest carries the lower end of the seat-shifting levers F to the right and their upper ends to the left, whereby through the gearing described the seat is shifted laterally to the left.\nHaving now described my invention, what I claim is 1. In a seat, the combination with a frame and movable cushion, of a seat-back, pivoted supporting-arms therefor, and pivoted levers, the lower ends of which are connected to and operate with said arms, their upper ends being provided with gearing coacting with corresponding gearing secured to said cushion or cushion-frame, substantially as described.\n2. In a seat, the combination with a frame and movable cushion, of a seat-back, pivoted supporting-arms therefor, a foot-rest extendin g between and connecting said pivoted arms, pivoted cushion-shifting levers having slotted lower ends engaging with said foot-rest, and toothed upper ends engaging with correspondingly-toothed tracks on the under side of said seat, substantially as described.\n3.

HOAGLAND, OF PERU, ILLINOIS.\nWHEEL.\nSPECIFICATION forming part of Letters I atent No. 640,198, dated January 2, 1900.\nApplication filed October 14, 1899. Serial No. 733,582. (No model.)\nTo all whom, it may concern.-\nBeitknown that I,WILLIAM K. HOAGLAND, a citizen of the United States,residin g at Peru, in the county of La Salle and State of Illinois, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in \\Vheels, of which the following is a specification, reference being had to the accompanying drawings.\nMy invention relates to improvements in wheels, and particularly to wheels which are formed wholly of metal. Heretofore it has been usual in wheels of this class to connect the spokes with the hub in such a way that it is difficult to remove them, and in case a spoke becomes broken the wheel is rendered useless.\nIt is one of the objects of my invention to make a metal wheel in which the spokes may be so secured to the hub that in case one of them is broken it may be readily detached and a new spoke put in its place.\nAnother object of my invention is to provide a new and improved hub particularly adapted for use in metal wheels, to which the spokes maybe firmly secured, but at the same time so secured that they may be easily detached therefrom.\nAnother object of my invention is to provide a new and improved device for clampin g the ends of spokes to the hub of a wheel so that they may be easily detached therefrom in case they become broken.\nI attain these objects as hereinafter specified and as illustrated in the drawings.\nThat which I regard as new will be set forth in the claims.\nIn the drawings, Figure 1 is a side view of a hub with portions of several spokes attached, the spokes being broken away a short distance from the hub. Fig. 2 is a detail, being a section on line 2 2 of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a detail, being a view of the clamp by which the spokes are secured to the hub; and Fig. 4 shows a modification, being a side view of the hub of a wheel with several spokes attached and broken away a short distance from the hub.\nReferring to the drawings, 0 indicates a central boss, which is provided with an opening 6, adapted to receive the end of an axle.\n7 indicates a circumferential circular plate,\nwhich is preferably formed integral with the boss 5.\n8 indicates grooves formed in the plate 7, extending from the circumference toward the center of the hub and of such shape as to form one half of a socket to receive the end of a spoke, the other half being formed by the clamping device hereinafter described.\n9 indicates openings in the hub placed one upon one side of each of the grooves 8 and adapted to receive a lug on the clamp hereinafter described.\n10 indicates openings in the plate 7,adapted to receive a bolt hereinafter described.\n11 indicates the clamp, which is formed with a recess 12, which corresponds in shape with the grooves 8 and is adapted when the clamp 11 is placed in position to register with the groove 8, so as to form a socket for the end of thespoke.\n13 indicates a lug formed upon the clamp 11 and having at its end a bent portion 14, which forms a shoulder adapted to engage with the surface of the plate 7 opposite to the surface upon which the clamps are placed. The lug 13 is adapted to enter the opening 9, whereby the clamp is pivotally engaged at one end with the plate or flange 7. 15indicates a shoulder formed upon the other side of the clamp from the lug 13, which is provided with an opening 16, adapted to receive a. bolt 17.\n18 indicates spokes, the ends of which are adapted to fit the sockets formed by the clamps 11 and the grooves Sin theplate when the clamps 11 are placed in position.\nIn putting the wheel together the lug 13 is inserted through the opening 9, the'end of the spoke 1S placed in the socket, which is formed by the registering of the recess in the clamp 11 with the groove 8, and the clamp 11 is tightly clamped upon the spoke by means of the bolt 17.\nIt will be obvious that the clamp 11 constitutes a species of lever which at one end pivotally engages the flange or plate 7 and by means of the bolt 17 is drawn down upon the spoke when in position, so as to tightly bind the spoke in the socket and firmly secure it to the hub.\nIn the modification shown in Fig. 4 Ihave shown a form of hubin which a greater number of spokes may be used. In this form the circular plate 7 is made larger and with a greater number of grooves. The grooves 8 extend from the periphery of the plate 7 to the central boss, and between them are grooves 8 which extend only aportion of the distance from the periphery of the plate 7 toward the boss 5, thus affording room for the clamping upon the hub of a greater number of spokes. The clamping devices are the same as above described.\nThat which I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-\n1. A hub provided with a circumferential flange having grooves forming each one half of a spoke-socket and with clamping-levers adapted at one end to pivotally engage said flange at one side of said groove, and having each a recess forming the other half of a spoke-socket, and with means for forcing the other end of said clamping-levers down toward and securing the same to said hub, suband a hub having grooves forming each one half of a spoke-socket, of clamping-levers adapted at one end to pivotally engage said hub and having each a recess adapted to coact with one of said grooves and form the other half of a spoke-socket, and means for forcing the other end of said clamping-levers toward and securing the same to said hub, substantially as described.\n4:. In a wheel, the combination with spokes, and a hub provided with a circumferential flange having grooves forming each one half of a spoke-socket, of clamping-levers adapted at one end to pivotally engage said hub and having each a recess adapted to coact with one of said grooves and form the other half of a spoke-socket, and means for forcing the other end of said clamping-levers toward and securing the same to said hub, substantially as described.\n5. In a wheel, the combination with spokes, of a hub having a circular plate provided with grooves and openings beside said grooves, clamps provided each with. a recess adapted to register with said grooves and form a spoke-socket, and with a lug at one end adapted to enter said openings and engage said plate, and devices for securing the other end of said clamp to said plate, substantially as described.\nWILLIAM K.
